# Augmented Awareness (AWW) – Yogic Map of the Mind

Below is a concise reference for the **16 dimensions** (kala) of the human mind as preserved in classical Upanishadic and Yogic literature, organised into the **four foundational categories** (antah‑karana) that AWW is designed to work with.

---

## 1. Chitta – Pure Consciousness / Field of Impressions
| # | Sanskrit (IAST) | Literal Sense | Brief Note |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | **Saṃjñāna** | Awareness, recognition | Primordial wakefulness; capacity to know that “I am”. |
| 2 | **Vijñāna** | Differentiated knowing | Direct seeing of “what is”, before thought colours it. |
| 3 | **Prajñāna** | Integral wisdom | Non‑conceptual intelligence pervading the life‑process. |
| 4 | **Dṛṣṭi** | Insight, vision | Inner sight that reveals patterns beneath experience. |

## 2. Manas – Sensory & Memory Mind
| # | Sanskrit (IAST) | Literal Sense | Brief Note |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 5 | **Smṛti** | Memory | Storage & recall of lived impressions. |
| 6 | **Medhā** | Retentiveness | Ability to hold data, associations, stories. |
| 7 | **Juti** | Impulse | Immediate reactive tendency of the nervous system. |
| 8 | **Āsu** | Vital force, vigour | Energetic tone that colours perception & mood. |

## 3. Buddhi – Discernment / Intellect
| # | Sanskrit (IAST) | Literal Sense | Brief Note |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 9 | **Ajñāna*** | Correct apprehension | Concept‑building that groups disparate inputs. |
| 10 | **Dhṛti** | Resolve, steadfastness | Decisive faculty that fixes priorities. |
| 11 | **Mati** | Opinion, judgment | Tendency to label experience as good/bad. |
| 12 | **Manīṣā** | Reflective reasoning | Directed analysis aiming at meaning. |

> *In this Upanishadic list **Ajñāna** designates “comprehension” – the opposite of modern “ignorance”.*

## 4. Ahankara – Sense of ‘I‑Am‑This’
| # | Sanskrit (IAST) | Literal Sense | Brief Note |
|---|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 13 | **Saṃkalpa** | Intent, resolve | Personal storyline we choose to pursue. |
| 14 | **Kratu** | Purpose, will to act | Inner commissioning statement that launches karma. |
| 15 | **Kāmaḥ** | Desire | Attractive pull that shapes identity around wants. |
| 16 | **Vaśa** | Dominance, control | Urge to assert authorship & direct outcomes. |

---

### How AWW Works With These Dimensions (Preview)

- **Primary Goal:** Free **Chitta** from being overshadowed when **Ahankara** is triggered and **Buddhi–Manas** resources are depleted.
- **Approach:** Offload raw sensory & contextual memory (Manas) plus preliminary pattern sorting (Buddhi) to external AI so that live awareness can stay present with experience.
- **Guard‑rail:** Constant checks to ensure the tool does **not** slip into merely amplifying Buddhi (analysis) at the cost of Chitta (direct presence). “*Yogaḥ citta‑vṛtti‑nirodhaḥ*” remains the north star.

*(The next section of the specification will expand on guiding principles, user journeys, data pipelines, and ethical constraints.)*

## Agentic OODA Loop in AWW

AWW operates as a **continuously running Observe → Orient → Direct → Act loop**. Each phase is informed by the four antah‑karana categories and their sixteen dimensions:

| OODA Phase | Yogic Mind Emphasis | What Happens |
|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Observe** | **Manas** (Smṛti, Medhā, Juti, Āsu) + external sensors | Collect raw perceptions from journal text, wearable metrics, location, calendar, ambient sound‑levels. |
| **Orient** | **Buddhi** (Ajñāna, Dhṛti, Mati, Manīṣā) | Infer context: detect stress spikes, align with user values & goals, run pattern‑recognition models. |
| **Direct (Decide)** | **Ahankara** (Saṃkalpa, Kratu, Kāmaḥ, Vaśa) *tempered by* **Chitta** insights | Propose course of action that safeguards balance rather than ego‑reinforcement. |
| **Act** | Reflective **Chitta** plus subtle **Buddhi** | Surface nudges, questions, or compiled reflections at the minimally intrusive moment. |

> **Design guard‑rail:** Each loop must include a *Chitta‑check* that asks, “Does this aid presence or merely add mental content?” Only then is a message sent.

### Day‑in‑the‑Life Interaction Examples

| Time | Situation | Wholesome Flow | Less‑Wholesome Flow | AWW Intervention (CUJ) |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 06:30 | **Wake‑up** – HRV high, sunlight entering room | User opens with 5‑min breath practice | Grabs phone, doomscrolls | **CUJ 1: Mindful Morning Ramp** – gentle chime → short centering prompt; records first mood tag. |
| 08:00 | Commuting / first meetings | Plans agenda mindfully, hydrated | Rushing, no breakfast, calendar clashes | **CUJ 2: Schedule Co‑regulation** – calendar conflict detected → suggests 3‑min micro‑pause + auto‑email to reschedule. |
| 12:30 | Lunch break | Balanced meal, 10‑min walk in park | Eats at desk, checks social media | **CUJ 3: Presence at Meals** – photo snap of plate triggers mindful‑eating audio cue. |
| 15:30 | Afternoon slump | Short walk + sunlight | Energy dip → caffeine + sugary snack | **CUJ 4: Energy Re‑alignment** – wearable detects posture drop → offers box‑breathing & daylight break suggestion. |
| 18:00 | Family / workout time | Plays with kids / gym session | Scrolls emails, skips workout | **CUJ 5: Boundary Guardian** – geo‑fence at home, silences work apps, surfaces playful activity ideas. |
| 22:30 | Wind‑down | Journals gratitude, blue‑light filters on | Netflix binge, sleep late | **CUJ 6: Sleep Transition** – detects screen time & melatonin mis‑alignment → dims lights via smart bulbs, proposes reflection.

### Weekly Rhythm Illustrations

- **Wholesome week:** 5 × 45‑min exercise, 3 home‑cooked dinners, 2 social gatherings, 1 solitude hike, 1 digital‑Sabbath.
- **Drift week:** Late nights 4/7, fast‑food 3×, social media >20 h, zero exercise.

AWW compares live metrics to baseline targets, highlighting trend deviations every Sunday evening via a *Weekly Insight Digest*.

### Critical User Journeys (CUJ) Summary

| # | Name | Trigger & Inputs | Desired Outcome | Risk if Fails |
|---|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Mindful Morning Ramp | Alarm event + motion sensor | Begin day present & unhurried | Reactivity from the first minute |
| 2 | Schedule Co‑regulation | Calendar clash, HRV spike | Restored synch & realistic pacing | Overcommitment, stress cycle |
| 3 | Presence at Meals | Food photo / location change | Slow, sensory‑rich eating | Mindless calories, digestion issues |
| 4 | Energy Re‑alignment | Posture + HR drop | Restore alertness without stimulants | Fatigue → compensatory sugar/caffeine |
| 5 | Boundary Guardian | Geo‑fence home / gym | Engagement with loved ones or body | Work bleed‑through, relationship strain |
| 6 | Sleep Transition | Light level + screen use | Smooth circadian descent | Insomnia, next‑day burnout |

### Key Use‑Case Taxonomy

1. **Stress‑Spike Intervention** – deploy 90‑second somatic regulation when HRV drops 20 %.
2. **Craving Override** – at habitual snack‑time uses *Manīṣā* to recall prior intentions, offers 3 alternate actions.
3. **Reflection Synthesiser** – composes nightly summary tagging events by Saṃjñāna (awareness gain) vs. Mati (judgment).
4. **Social Media Dopamine Brake** – detects 10‑minute continuous scroll; inserts Patanjali sutra micro‑lesson.
5. **Goal‑Alignment Check‑in** – weekly linkage of Saṃkalpa (intent) with concretised tasks; prompts renegotiation.

These CUJs feed the **system architecture** (next section) where each journey translates into pipelines, ML models, and UI surfaces tuned to safeguard *Yogaḥ citta‑vṛtti‑nirodhaḥ*. The guiding principle remains: *inspire embodied presence first, analysis later.*

## Agent Prompt Library – Generalised Micro‑Agent Prompts

> *Every micro‑agent below is designed to run continuously and respond to **generic classes of events**, rather than to a fixed set of CUJ‑specific triggers.*  Each prompt includes:
> 1. **Role** (who the agent is in the internal ecology)
> 2. **Trigger class** (broad event type or state change)
> 3. **Task** (what must be produced)
> 4. **Guard‑rails & contract** (universal constraints and JSON schema)

For placeholders we use the notation `<<variable_name>>`, to be bound at runtime by the orchestration layer.

---

These generalized prompts are free of specific CUJ references, allowing the orchestration layer to bind them to **any** situational data stream or behavioural pattern. The earlier CUJs and use‑cases are still fully covered because the orchestration layer can emit the appropriate generic triggers (`<<state_shift_event>>`, `<<stress_indicator>>`, etc.) under those scenarios.

## System Architecture – Autonomously Asynchronous Augmented Awareness

### 1. Design Principles
| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Presence‑first** | Real‑time features must never hijack the user’s attention; nudges only after *Chitta‑check* passes. |
| **Autonomous & Asynchronous** | AWW runs continuously at its own slower computational rhythm, queuing heavy analysis for off‑peak cycles. |
| **Event‑Driven** | Everything is triggered by events on a pub/sub bus—sensor readings, journal saves, schedule ticks. |
| **Privacy‑by‑Isolation** | All personally identifying raw data stays on‑device; cloud only receives abstracted embeddings/metrics. |
| **Composable Agents** | The 16 micro‑agents are stateless containers pluggable into any pipeline. |

### 2. Component Stack
| Layer | Core Services | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Edge & Sensor Layer** | Mobile app, wearables SDKs, smart‑home hooks | Emits raw signals (HRV, location, light, keystrokes). |
| **Ingestion Gateway** | Local message broker (MQTT / gRPC) | Debounces high‑frequency signals, attaches timestamps. |
| **Event Bus** | Lightweight pub/sub (NATS / Redis Streams) | Single channel for both real‑time and batch events. |
| **Context Services** | • Time‑Series DB (Influx/Timescale)  \• Episodic Memory Store (Vector DB)  \• Value‑Intent KV Store | Provides the “Orient” substrate for all agents. |
| **Agent Mesh** | 16 micro‑agent containers (LLM endpoints) | Calls orchestrated via prompt templates in canvas. |
| **Meta‑Controller** | OODA Orchestrator + Chitta‑Check policy engine | Routes events to agents, applies guard‑rails, throttles notifications. |
| **Scheduler** | Cron & Quartz jobs (nightly ∆T, weekly digest) | Launches heavy summarisation, alignment review. |
| **Rendezvous Manager** | Notification throttle + User pull API | Chooses *when* to interrupt or wait for user‑initiated check‑in. |
| **UI Surfaces** | • Mobile “Moment Card” stream  \• Wearable haptics  \• Ambient displays  \• Reflection dashboard | Pull vs. push channels aligned to Observe vs. Reflect modes. |
| **Privacy & Security** | Differential privacy layer, local enclave, encrypted transit | Satisfies GDPR / HIPAA class compliance. |

### 3. OODA Execution Modes
| Mode | Frequency | Compute Tier | Typical Work |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Real‑Time** | 0–500 ms | On‑device CPU | Detect spikes, deliver micro‑nudges (e.g., Saṃjñāna, Vijñāna). |
| **Near‑Real‑Time** | 5–30 s | Edge TPU / local GPU | Short context binding, schedule re‑assessment. |
| **Deferred Batch** | Hourly | Local + Cloud CPU | Update value alignment, incremental learning. |
| **Nightly Deep Reflection** | 22:00‑05:00 | Cloud GPU spot instances | Prajñāna digest, trend modelling, intent drift detection. |
| **Weekly & Monthly** | Sunday night | Cloud GPU reserved | Boundary renegotiation, long‑term pattern synthesis. |

### 4. Rendezvous Points
1. **Micro‑Nudge** – Meta‑Controller authorises an interrupt *only* if: relevance HIGH ∧ user‑context LOW‑distraction.
2. **User Pull** – At any moment the user can open the Moment Card stream or ask, “AWW, what’s unfolding?”
3. **Scheduled Digest** – Nightly and weekly summaries land in the Reflection dashboard; mobile ping is **silent** until user opens the app.
4. **Boundary Enforcement** – Vaśa may dim screen or lock app without alert if boundary_violation_risk crosses threshold.

### 5. Data Flow Walk‑Through
**Observe → Orient:**
- Sensor/Journal event → Ingestion Gateway → Event Bus.
- Meta‑Controller derives `<<state_shift_event>>`, passes to relevant agents (Saṃjñāna, Āsu…).

**Direct → Act:**
- Agent JSON output goes back on bus → Rendezvous Manager decides channel & timing → UI Surface renders.

**Chron Jobs:**
- Scheduler posts `<<periodic_reflection_window>>` at 02:00 each night.
- Prajñāna & Dṛṣṭi consume, generate digest & reframes.
- Ajñāna recomputes alignment scores for upcoming commitments.

### 6. Resource Stewardship
- **Power‑Aware Queueing:** Mobile defers non‑urgent uploads until >60 % battery ∧ on Wi‑Fi.
- **Graceful Degradation:** If cloud unreachable, switch to lightweight on‑device distilled models.

### 7. Extensibility Hooks
- New sensors publish to Event Bus with minimal schema: `{type, timestamp, payload}`.
- New agents register prompt + trigger pattern, no core code change.

This architecture lets AWW live at its own contemplative pace—*slow enough to be wise, quick enough to care*—while ensuring user autonomy and minimal intrusion remain intact.
