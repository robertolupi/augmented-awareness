# Agentic AI Bot – OODA Whiteboard Design Doc

## Introduction

This document outlines the design for an agentic AI bot that aims to help people live a more wholesome life by leveraging the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop. The system relies on a shared knowledge base—referred to here as the “whiteboard”—through which sensors, orienters, deciders, and actuators can communicate and cooperate.

## Overview of the OODA Loop

1. **Observe:** Gather raw data from sensors or external sources.
2. **Orient:** Transform or interpret data into meaningful insights.
3. **Decide:** Determine the best course of action.
4. **Act:** Carry out decisions through actuators.

## The Whiteboard

The whiteboard is a central knowledge base where:

- **Sensors** publish data.
- **Orienters** read raw data, aggregate or summarize it, and write back insights.
- **Deciders** read insights, generate decisions, and publish them.
- **Actuators** read decisions and execute actions.

## Architecture

1. **Data Flow**: Asynchronous, event-driven updates to the whiteboard.
2. **Integration**: Multiple sources can push data, with concurrency in handling new information.
3. **Scalability**: Whiteboard should support large volumes of data and multiple agent components.

## Observers/Sensors

- Publish raw data such as user interactions, system metrics, or external events.
- Provide event timestamps and metadata for traceability.

## Orienters

- Read and interpret raw data.
- Summarize, classify, or extract features from inputs.
- Publish higher-level insights or structured data.

## Deciders

- Read insights from the whiteboard.
- Use decision-making logic or ML models to generate recommended actions.
- Publish decisions and rationale.

## Actuators

- Read decisions.
- Execute actions, such as sending notifications or updating a user dashboard.
- Provide feedback or confirmation logs to the whiteboard.

## Extensibility

- Allow new sensor/orienter/decider/actuator modules to be plugged in.
- Support specialized modules for specific tasks (e.g., image processing, text analysis, user behavior modeling).

## Security & Privacy

- Offline-first, Local-first
- Data minimization and anonymization where possible.
