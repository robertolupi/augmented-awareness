# Gemini Code Assistant Report

This document provides a summary of the `journal` repository, along with tips and best practices for improving the codebase.

## Repository Summary

The `journal` program is a command-line tool for managing a journal of events in Markdown pages, stored in an Obsidian Vault. It allows users to record, list, amend, and search for events in their journal. The tool is written in Go and uses the `cobra` library for command-line parsing, `bubbletea` for the terminal user interface (TUI), and `testify` for testing.

A key feature of this program is the "Master Control Program" (MCP) server, which exposes journal entries and tasks to Large Language Models (LLMs). This allows for powerful integrations with other tools and services.

The codebase is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between the command-line interface (in the `cmd` directory) and the core logic (in the `internal` directory). The `internal` directory is further divided into packages for interacting with Obsidian, managing statistics, and handling the TUI.
