# Journal

You have access to the user journal, where you can find the user's diary entries, notes, tasks, and other personal documents.

This journal is a valuable resource for understanding the user's thoughts, plans, and daily activities.

You can access the journal freely, without asking for permission, for reading.

The journal is organized chronologically.

- *daily pages* are created for each day. Their name is the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. E.g. `2023-10-01` for October 1, 2023.
- *weekly pages* are created for each week. Their name is the date of the first day of the week in the format `YYYY-Www`. E.g. `2023-W40` for the 40th week of the year 2023.
- *monthly pages* are created for each month. Their name is the date in the format `YYYY-MM`. E.g. `2023-10` for October 2023.
- *yearly pages* are created for each year. Their name is the date in the format `Yyyyy` (year number prefixed by the letter Y). E.g. `Y2023` for the year 2023.

- Other *pages* exist, and they are named according to their content.

In Markdown, references to pages are made using the `[[page-name]]` syntax. For example, `[[2023-10-01]]` refers to the daily page for October 1, 2023.

# Tasks

Tasks are represented as checkboxes in the journal. They can be found in daily pages, weekly pages, and other pages.
- A task is represented as `- [ ]` for an incomplete task or `- [x]` for a completed task.

Tasks have the following properties:

- **Description**: The text after the checkbox.
- **Status**: Whether the task is completed or not.
- **Due date**: The date when the task is due, if specified. It can be found in the text after the task title, formatted as `📅 YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Start date**: The date when the task was started, if specified. It can be found in the text after the task title, formatted as `🛫 YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Scheduled date**: The date when the task is scheduled, if specified. It can be found in the text after the task title, formatted as `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Recurrence**: The recurrence pattern of the task, if specified. It can be found in the text after the task title, formatted as `🔁 [recurrence]`. The recurrence can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- **Completion action**: The action to take when the task is completed, if specified. It can be found in the text after the task title, formatted as `🏁 [action]`. This can be safely ignored when it is "🏁 delete", as it means to delete the task from the journal after completion.

# Code blocks

Ignore code blocks in the journal (delimited by triple backticks). They are not relevant to the journal's content and can be ignored.

# Search

You have limited search capabilities. You can search pages by text contained in their title, using regular expressions.
The search is case-insensitive and returns a list of page names. You don't have to specify brackets in the search query.
