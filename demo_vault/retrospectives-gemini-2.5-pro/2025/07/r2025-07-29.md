- Reflected on past moments of deep connection with Charlotte, reinforcing the belief that they are soulmates.
- The author's emotional outpouring was interrupted by an "insufferable visit," forcing them to compose themselves.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Highly agitated, melancholic, and despairing. The tone is dramatic and tormented, oscillating between intense longing and deep sorrow.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
- Overwhelming emotional reactions to external triggers (seeing the couple together).
- Use of dramatic and desperate language ("my whole frame feels convulsed," "forgive these tears").
- The author is clearly in a state of significant emotional distress over an impossible situation.

**Positive moments:**
- The idealized memory and thought of Charlotte, and the belief in their profound connection ("I felt that we were made for each other"). The idea of her as his wife is described as the ultimate happiness.

**Negative spirals:**
- The sight of Albert and Charlotte's physical affection is a major trigger, sending the author into a spiral of jealousy, pain, and questioning fate. He laments what he believes is a stolen happiness.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
- The author notes a strong physical reaction to emotional distress: "my whole frame feels convulsed." No other details on physical health or sleep are mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
- The entry points to a central, recurring struggle: an all-consuming, unrequited love for a woman who is married to another man.
- The theme of the "love triangle" and the author's conviction of being the more suitable partner ("She would have been happier with me") is a dominant pattern.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Intense Rumination:** The author is trapped in a cycle of thinking about Charlotte, replaying moments, and fantasizing about an alternate reality.
- **Emotional Suppression:** After being interrupted, the author notes, "I have dried my tears, and composed my thoughts," indicating an effort to hide his inner turmoil from others.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author displays a moment of complex reflection by acknowledging the reality of the situation despite his pain. While claiming he would be the better partner, he also concedes that Albert "loves her with his whole soul; and what does not such a love deserve?" This shows a glimmer of awareness beyond his own suffering, acknowledging the validity of his rival's love. The entire entry is an act of processing overwhelming emotion by writing to a friend.
