### 1. Key Events
- The author dined with Count O— and unintentionally stayed for an evening assembly reserved for the nobility.
- He felt snubbed by several aristocratic guests, including a family he detests and a woman (Miss B—) he admires.
- The Count politely asked him to leave to appease the other guests, causing the author deep humiliation.
- He attempted to recover by taking a drive and reading Homer, which brought a moment of peace.
- Later that evening, he learned that the incident had already become a topic of public gossip, which intensified his distress and anger.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** The entry cycles from dramatic despair and frustration to humiliation, a brief moment of calm, and finally to intense bitterness, resentment, and rage.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
- The author feels trapped in a role for which he is "by no means suited."
- He shows extreme sensitivity to social hierarchy and perceived slights.
- The public nature of his humiliation is a significant stressor, leading to feelings of paranoia and persecution.
- He expresses a feeling of losing all patience and a desire for self-harm ("could plunge a dagger into my bosom").

**Positive moments:**
- He initially enjoyed the company of the Count and Colonel B—.
- He experienced a "heartfelt pleasure" upon seeing Miss B—.
- He found a "delightful" respite in watching the sunset and reading Homer after the incident.

**Negative spirals:**
- The author's mood soured when he noticed the condescending attitude of the noble guests and the changed demeanor of Miss B—.
- The true spiral began when he was informed that his humiliation was being widely discussed. This led to rumination ("I fancied that every one who sat down...was thinking of this incident") and transformed his private shame into an all-consuming public torment.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep
Not mentioned in this entry.

### 4. Recurring Themes
While direct links to previous entries are not provided, the author alludes to several recurring patterns:
- **"Impetuous temper":** He mentions that others might attribute the incident to this trait, suggesting it's a known aspect of his personality.
- **Social class conflict:** His status as a "subaltern" in aristocratic circles is a clear and painful source of ongoing conflict and sensitivity.
- **Need for validation:** He notes that he has told his correspondent "a hundred times" that the Count likes him, indicating a pattern of seeking reassurance about his social standing.
- **Perceived enemies:** The bitterness towards those who laugh at him suggests a recurring struggle with feeling persecuted and judged by others.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Externalizing blame:** The entry begins by directly blaming the recipient for putting him in this untenable position ("you alone are to blame").
- **Avoidant coping:** His immediate reaction to the humiliation was to physically escape the situation, drive to a scenic hill, and distract himself with literature (Homer).
- **Rumination:** After learning the incident was public, he became fixated on the idea that everyone was watching and judging him, amplifying his distress.
- **Prideful defense:** He initially tries to save face by acting nonchalant ("Deuce take the assembly! I was very glad to be gone"), but this defense crumbles under the weight of public gossip.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author learns that theoretical "fortitude" is insufficient in the face of real-world public ridicule. He acknowledges his own "inattention" but concludes that the most painful thing is enduring the laughter of "fools" when they have a factual, even if minor, advantage. The insight is that stoicism fails when one's pride is wounded publicly, and the judgment of others, however foolish, can be unbearable.
