### 1. Key Events
- The author met "Miss B—" and questioned her about her recently altered, distant manner.
- Miss B— explained her distress was out of sympathy for him, not coldness. She revealed that she had anticipated a social snub he received, where other guests would leave rather than be in his company.
- She confessed that she was forced to listen to her aunt and others condemn and criticize the author and their acquaintance, and she felt unable to properly defend him.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Highly agitated, swinging from hurt and confusion to frantic rage and deep despair.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
- The author feels intensely persecuted and humiliated by social rejection ("punishment of my pride").
- He describes being in a "state of extreme excitement" and feeling "frantic," indicating a complete loss of emotional regulation.
- Every word from Miss B— is described as a "dagger to my heart," showing extreme emotional sensitivity and pain.

**Positive moments:**
- None. The brief hope of receiving a comforting explanation from Miss B— is immediately replaced by greater pain upon hearing the details of his social condemnation.

**Negative spirals:**
- The conversation triggers a powerful negative spiral. Hearing that others are gossiping about him and that Miss B— couldn't defend him sends him into a state of fury.
- This spirals into violent fantasies of revenge ("The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury").
- The rage then turns inward, culminating in strong suicidal ideation as a perceived means of escape and relief ("seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart," "open a vein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty").

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
- The author feels "heated and exhausted" from emotional distress.
- He mentions a feeling of being an "oppressed heart" and desires to "breathe more freely," suggesting psychosomatic symptoms of anxiety and pressure.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
- (No previous entries provided for comparison).
- The themes within this entry are profound social alienation, the pain of being misunderstood and condemned, and a deep-seated pride that makes social humiliation unbearable. There is a clear pattern of external social events triggering extreme internal emotional turmoil.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- Confronting others directly about perceived emotional shifts.
- Fantasizing about extreme violence towards those who mock him.
- Experiencing intense suicidal ideation as a response to emotional pain, describing it as a way to find "everlasting liberty" and "ease." The act of seizing a dagger is a notable escalation.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author does not demonstrate much self-reflection; he is entirely consumed by his emotional reaction. The one piece of meta-cognition is his observation that Miss B— "did not feel what a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me." This shows an awareness of how her sharing the information exacerbated his pain, but it's framed by his own suffering rather than an understanding of her difficult position. He does not appear to learn anything from the experience beyond the confirmation of his social downfall, which only fuels his despair.
