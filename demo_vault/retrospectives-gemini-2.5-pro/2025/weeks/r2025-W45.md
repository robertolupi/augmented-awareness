### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was bookended by profound emotional crises. The primary stressor was an overwhelming sense of despair and spiritual emptiness early in the week, marked by suicidal ideation and anhedonia. This internal turmoil later coalesced around an external stressor: an obsessive and unreciprocated attachment to Charlotte, which led to a gentle but firm confrontation about his increased alcohol consumption. The single, albeit complex, highlight was the moment of "tenderness" from Charlotte, which, despite being a reproof, represented a rare moment of human connection.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began in a state of extreme low energy and mood, described as "wretched" despair and emotional numbness. There was no recovery in energy, with the author noting later that his "energies are all prostrated." However, the mood's character shifted. The initial, all-encompassing internal despair evolved into a focused melancholy, centered entirely on his obsessive feelings for Charlotte. The emotional state remained negative but became less generalized and more targeted.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental and physical health saw a clear decline. The week started with severe depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation, anhedonia, and intense self-blame. This poor mental state directly manifested in a negative physical health trend: by the end of the week, the author's use of wine as a coping mechanism had increased to a level noticeable by others, indicating a turn towards substance use to manage his emotional pain.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A pattern of compulsive rumination dominated the week. It began as intense, inward-focused self-blame and analysis of his own misery. This obsessive thinking then shifted its focus outward, latching onto Charlotte. The primary avoidant behavior to emerge was the increased consumption of wine, a clear attempt to numb the emotional distress documented at the start of the week.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The week's actions were driven by desperation rather than proactive choice. The most significant early action was a prayer, a desperate plea to break through emotional numbness. The most consequential later action was the passive decision to increase alcohol intake, which served as a negative coping strategy and triggered an intervention from Charlotte. There is no evidence of constructive action towards healing or changing his circumstances.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The week's central theme is the **transference of pain**. The narrative arc moves from an internal, spiritual crisis (#despair, #selfblame) to an external, relational one (#Obsession, #UnrequitedLove). The underlying suffering remains constant, but its focus shifts. Another key theme is **powerlessness**; the author feels helpless first against his own internal state and later declares himself completely subservient to his feelings for Charlotte. The use of alcohol (#AlcoholUse) emerges as a new, tangible theme representing a failing attempt to manage this powerlessness.
