### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The pivotal event of the week was the finalization of the author's resignation from their court post, marking a significant life transition. This was unexpectedly highlighted by a parting gift of 25 ducats from the crown prince, an act of kindness that provided both financial and emotional relief. The primary stressor was the resignation process itself, which was evidently difficult and met with reluctance from superiors. An underlying and persistent stressor is the anticipated conflict with the author's mother, whose potential for sabotage influenced the timing and nature of the author's communications.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week culminated in a complex emotional state characterized by relief, heightened sensitivity, and apprehension. Having navigated the high-stress period leading up to the resignation, the author's mood shifted to one of fragile but determined forward movement. The relief of the decision being final is palpable, yet it's tempered by the emotional weight of the transition and the looming family conflict.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health this week was defined by the management of a major life change. The author demonstrated proactive coping strategies by consciously avoiding rumination on the negative aspects of their departure and strategically managing communication to protect their emotional state. This indicates a focus on self-preservation during a turbulent time. Physical health was not mentioned.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A clear pattern of strategic avoidance emerged. The author delayed informing family of their plans until the resignation was irreversible, a tactic designed to preempt interference. They also withheld painful details about the process, suggesting a learned behavior to manage both their own and others' emotional distress in response to conflict.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The most meaningful action was the resignation itselfâ€”a decisive step toward self-determination and a new life path. A secondary but powerful decision was the withdrawal of a financial request to their mother upon receiving the gift from the prince. This act reinforced their move toward independence and severed a potential tie of dependency and control.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The dominant themes are **Career Change** and the pursuit of autonomy, both personal and financial. These goals are set against a backdrop of persistent **Family Conflict** and the high-pressure environment of **Court Life**. The week represents a definitive break from the past and a conscious step toward a **New Beginning**.
