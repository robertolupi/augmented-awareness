### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week's defining event was a severe social humiliation at an aristocratic gathering, where the author was politely asked to leave to appease other guests. This central stressor was intensely magnified upon learning the incident had become public gossip. The subsequent attempt to seek clarity from a confidante, Miss B—, served only to confirm the extent of the social condemnation, acting as a secondary, devastating blow that plunged the author into a deeper crisis. The only fleeting highlight was a brief moment of peace found in nature and literature immediately after the initial incident, a calm that was quickly shattered.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week was characterized by a rapid and severe emotional decline. The mood began with social discomfort, which spiraled into acute humiliation and resentment on Saturday. After a brief, fragile recovery, the conversation on Sunday triggered a complete emotional collapse. The author's state escalated from agitation and hurt to "frantic" rage and profound despair. This emotional turmoil appeared physically draining, leaving him feeling "heated and exhausted" and utterly consumed by his distress.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health deteriorated into a state of crisis. The author exhibited extreme emotional dysregulation, hypersensitivity, and paranoid rumination about being judged by others. The emotional distress culminated in active suicidal ideation by the end of the weekend, with thoughts of violence turning inward and the author physically seizing a dagger as a potential means of escape. Physically, the stress manifested in psychosomatic symptoms, including a feeling of being "heated" and an "oppressed heart," suggesting a powerful mind-body connection to his anxiety.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A pattern of reacting to social injury with extreme measures became clear. Initially, the author employed avoidant coping by physically fleeing the scene of his humiliation. However, this quickly gave way to a compulsive need for answers, leading to the direct confrontation with Miss B—. The most dangerous emerging pattern was the escalation of emotional pain into fantasies of violence—first directed at those who mocked him, and then turned inward into a tangible desire for self-harm as a release from his suffering.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The most pivotal action of the week was the decision to confront Miss B—. This act, likely driven by a desperate need for validation or explanation, proved to be a catastrophic miscalculation. Instead of providing relief, her sympathetic confirmation of his social rejection served as the catalyst that transformed his deep resentment into an acute suicidal crisis, making it the week's most consequential and damaging decision.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The dominant theme is the catastrophic impact of social rejection on a proud and hypersensitive individual. The author’s sense of self appears inextricably linked to his social standing and public perception. The underlying tension of **class consciousness**—his precarious position as a commoner in aristocratic circles—is the clear source of the conflict. This external pressure interacts with his internal **pride** to create a volatile mixture, where perceived slights are interpreted as acts of persecution, leading to an extreme emotional spiral.
