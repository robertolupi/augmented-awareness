# r2025-W13

### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was defined by a single, momentous decision: resigning from a high-pressure position at "the court." The primary highlight was securing an escape in the form of an invitation from a Prince to his country house, offering a promise of autonomy and relief. The main stressor was not the decision itself, but the anticipated fallout from family, particularly the mother, who is expected to disapprove of the abandoned career path.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began with a mood of weary resolve. The decision to leave was born from exhaustion rather than excitement, creating a mix of relief, guilt, and defensiveness. Energy levels appear to be at a critical low, marked by a feeling of being "unable to do anything," suggesting a state of profound burnout.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health is the central concern. The week started in what appears to be a state of severe burnout or a depressive episode, characterized by feelings of inadequacy and being overwhelmed. The resignation was a direct act of self-preservation in response to this mental health crisis. Physical health, though not detailed, is implicitly poor, as suggested by the deep mental and emotional exhaustion.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A clear pattern of avoidance emerged in the handling of the resignation's announcement. The author has chosen to delegate the task of informing their mother, actively sidestepping a difficult emotional confrontation. The drastic action of leaving a career and immediately seeking refuge under another's patronage suggests a pattern of needing external structure and support, rather than navigating true independence.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The most significant action of the week was the resignation. This was a pivotal, life-altering decision that prioritized personal well-being over professional status and familial expectations, stemming from a moment of stark self-awareness about personal limitations.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The dominant themes emerging this week are the intense conflict between career pressure and personal well-being, the weight of family expectations, and the desperate need for escape. The core narrative is one of hitting a breaking point and taking drastic measures to find relief.
