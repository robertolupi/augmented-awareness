### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was defined by a significant emotional event that served as both a stressor and a point of painful clarity. The primary stressor was witnessing an intimate moment between Charlotte and her husband, Albert, which triggered an immediate and visceral reaction of jealousy and despair. The week's "highlight," paradoxically, was the reinforcement of the author's deep-seated belief in a soulmate connection with Charlotte, a conviction that fuels both the longing and the anguish.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began with a mood of extreme volatility, swinging from idealized, melancholic longing for a shared past to acute, agitated despair in the face of present reality. The emotional energy was entirely consumed by this intense internal conflict, leaving the author feeling tormented and physically affected by the psychological distress.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health appears fragile, dominated by obsessive thoughts about an unattainable love. The author is experiencing significant emotional turmoil, characterized by dramatic swings and a sense of hopelessness. A strong psychosomatic link is evident, with this mental anguish manifesting physically as a full-body convulsion, indicating that the emotional stress is taking a direct physical toll.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A clear pattern of compulsive rumination is present. The author is caught in a cycle of replaying memories, fantasizing about what could have been, and lamenting the current situation. This is paired with a form of emotional suppression; when faced with an interruption, there's an immediate effort to hide the inner turmoil and present a composed exterior, suggesting a behavioral pattern of masking deep emotional pain from others.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The most meaningful action was an internal one: grappling with the torment of jealousy. Amid the pain, a moment of profound, if painful, reflection occurred. The author acknowledged the genuine love his rival, Albert, has for Charlotte, recognizing that "such a love deserves" something in return. This demonstrates a capacity for empathy and complex thought beyond simple self-pity, even while in a state of deep suffering.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The dominant theme is the classic #love_triangle, fueled by a powerful sense of #unrequited_love. The central conflict is the author's conviction that he and Charlotte are #soulmates, pitted against the unchangeable reality of her marriage. This creates a powerful narrative of #emotional_turmoil and #jealousy that defines the week's experience.
