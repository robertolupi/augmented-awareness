### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was defined by two distinct, high-stakes crises. The primary highlight was a moment of profound mentorship, where a minister's validating and "noble" letter successfully de-escalated a severe work conflict, persuading the author to rescind a tendered resignation. This professional validation, however, was overshadowed by the week's principal stressor: the devastating news of Charlotte and Albert's wedding, which plunged the author into a deep personal crisis of heartbreak and despair.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week's emotional trajectory was a dramatic rollercoaster. It began with intense professional indignation and frustration, which resolved into a fragile state of calm and restored purpose by Monday. This hard-won peace was shattered mid-week by the personal news, causing a violent swing from contentment into acute agony and fatalism by Thursday. The week illustrates a pattern of finding temporary external resolution, only to have it completely undone by deep-seated internal turmoil.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health was extremely volatile. The author demonstrated a high sensitivity to both professional and personal events, reacting to a "gentle" reprimand with a desire to resign and to personal loss with fears of "becoming mad." The core challenge appears to be a profound difficulty with emotional regulation, swinging between functional idealism at work and debilitating obsession in his personal life. Physical health was not mentioned.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A powerful pattern of compulsive attachment emerged. Faced with the finality of Charlotte's marriage, the author made a conscious decision to reverse a healthy step toward closure. Instead of taking down her portrait, he chose to keep the painful reminder, rationalizing this act of self-torture as a way to preserve his "place" in her heart. This behavior highlights a compulsion to cling to the source of his pain, avoiding the process of letting go. The earlier impulse to resign can be seen as an avoidant reactionâ€”an attempt to flee a difficult professional dynamic rather than navigate it.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
Two pivotal decisions defined the week. First, the choice to remain in his post after the minister's intervention, which signaled an acceptance of mentorship and a willingness to temper his passionate nature. The second, and more consequential, was the decision to keep Charlotte's portrait. This was not a passive failure to move on, but an active choice to embrace his suffering, setting a deliberate course for continued obsession and heartbreak.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The week underscores the **transient nature of peace**, with the author's reflection on Monday that contentment is "transitory" being proven brutally true just days later. A central theme is the clash between **idealism and reality**; his professional "ardour" is recognized but requires moderation, while his idealized love for Charlotte is shattered by the reality of her marriage, leading him to retreat further into obsession rather than acceptance. His emotional state appears highly dependent on **external validation**, lacking a stable internal core.
