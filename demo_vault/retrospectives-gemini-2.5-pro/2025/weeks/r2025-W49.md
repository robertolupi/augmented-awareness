### 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was dominated by a descent into emotional turmoil, initiated by learning the tragic backstory of Wilhelm, a man driven mad by unrequited love for Charlotte. This story served as a powerful stressor, acting as a dark mirror for the author's own feelings. The primary crisis point occurred mid-week during a visit with Charlotte, where the sight of her wedding ring and the sound of a familiar song triggered a complete emotional breakdown, culminating in an abrupt and tormented departure. The week ended under the weight of an all-consuming obsession, with intrusive thoughts and a profound sense of existential dread becoming the main sources of stress.

### 2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began with a mood of high agitation and disturbed fascination, which quickly spiraled downward. By Thursday, this had plummeted into acute despair and torment, with the author explicitly stating he had reached a breaking point. The emotional trajectory continued its decline, settling into a state of deep, fatalistic melancholy by Saturday. Energy was entirely consumed by obsessive rumination and emotional crises, leaving a pervasive sense of powerlessness and exhaustion.

### 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health deteriorated rapidly and severely. The week charts a clear path from identifying with another's tragedy to experiencing a personal emotional collapse. This decline was so pronounced that it became externally visible, with Charlotte observing that the author was "ill." While specific physical symptoms were not detailed, sleep was noted as being significantly disturbed by obsessive thoughts, linking the intense mental anguish directly to a state of physical unrest and unwellness.

### 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A powerful pattern of compulsive rumination defined the week. The author was trapped in obsessive thought loops about Wilhelm's fate, his own unrequited love, painful memories, and the futility of existence. This was coupled with a tendency to romanticize tragedy, viewing suffering as a profound or even enviable state. When faced with direct emotional triggers, the author's pattern was one of dysregulation (uncontrolled weeping, agitation) followed by an avoidant flight response, physically removing himself from the source of pain rather than coping with it.

### 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The week was marked by a lack of proactive decisions, with the author being driven by overwhelming emotional currents. The most significant "action" was the decision to flee from Charlotte's presence on Thursday. This was not a considered choice but a desperate, reactive escape from unbearable pain, signifying that a critical threshold had been crossed where social composure was no longer possible.

### 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The central theme is the destructive and all-consuming nature of **unrequited love**, which serves as the lens through which all other experiences are viewed. This personal torment expands into a broader theme of **existential despair**, where individual suffering is seen as evidence of universal futility. A related theme is the **torment of memory**, as past joys become weaponized by present sorrow. The narrative arc of the week is clearly one of an **emotional breaking point**, moving from obsession to crisis to resignation.
