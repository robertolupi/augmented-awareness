# r2025-11-03

### 1. Key Events
*   The author awoke with a feeling of wretchedness and a wish they hadn't.
*   They observed a beautiful morning scene from their window but felt completely unmoved by it.
*   In a moment of desperation, they knelt and prayed to God for the ability to feel and cry.
*   The entry concludes with a reflection on happier "bygone days."

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:**
Profound despair, hopelessness, and emotional numbness (anhedonia). The author feels "wretched," and describes their heart as "dead" and withered.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
*   A clear expression of suicidal ideation ("a wish... that I may never awaken again").
*   Anhedonia: The inability to derive joy or any emotional response from things that should be beautiful, like nature ("ineffectual to extract one tear of joy").
*   Feelings of being overwhelmed by an "insupportable load of trouble."
*   Emotional exhaustion, described as senses that "wither and consume my brain."

**Positive moments:**
None in the present. The only positive feelings are recalled from a past state of being, where the author "enjoyed an excess of happiness" and felt connected to the world.

**Negative spirals:**
The entry is a deep dive into a negative spiral. The author engages in intense self-blame, rejecting any external cause for their misery ("I am alone the cause of my own woe"). This leads to feelings of worthlessness and alienation, feeling like a "reprobate before heaven." The memory of past happiness is not comforting but "torments" them, deepening the sense of loss.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   The author mentions lying down and waking up, but the focus is on the wish for death rather than sleep quality.
*   There are psychosomatic notes: "my eyes are dry" from an inability to cry, and a general feeling of being "withered."

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   **Contrast between past and present:** The entry is built on a painful comparison between a vibrant, happy past and the current deadened state. This suggests a recurring pattern of looking back with tormenting nostalgia.
*   **Loss of inner connection/creativity:** The author mourns the loss of "that active, sacred power which created worlds around me," pointing to a recurring struggle with a loss of inspiration, spirituality, or core sense of self.
*   **Relationship with God/Faith:** The author prays but also feels that God "does not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate entreaties," indicating a strained or questioning faith.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Intense Rumination:** The author is entirely consumed by analyzing their own sorrow and its origins.
*   **Self-Blame:** There is a compulsive need to take full responsibility for the pain, explicitly rejecting external factors.
*   **Desperate Prayer:** Kneeling to beg for tears is a notable action, highlighting a desperate desire to break through the emotional numbness.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author gains a small but significant insight at the end. They identify the source of their past happiness: it stemmed from an attitude of patience and gratitude ("I then waited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal, and received his gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart"). This is a meta-cognitive moment where they understand the psychological conditions of their former well-being, even if they cannot currently replicate them. They recognize that the source of both their past joy and current sorrow resides within themselves.
