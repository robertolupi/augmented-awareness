### 1. Key Events
- Charlotte confronted the author about his recent increase in wine consumption, expressing her concern with "tenderness."
- The author responded with an intense declaration of his constant thoughts of her.
- Charlotte cut the conversation short by changing the subject, seemingly uncomfortable with his intensity.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

**Mood:** Melancholy, obsessive, and emotionally dependent. The author feels a sense of despair and powerlessness, dominated by his feelings for Charlotte.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** The author explicitly states his "energies are all prostrated," indicating a state of profound emotional and mental exhaustion.

**Positive moments:** The author perceived Charlotte's concern and "tenderness" as a positive interaction, even though it was a reproof.

**Negative spirals:** The author's mind is completely consumed by Charlotte ("you are ever before my soul"), leading to a feeling of total subjugation and helplessness ("she can do with me what she pleases").

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
- The author notes a recent habit of "drinking more wine than heretofore," indicating an increase in alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
- This entry points to a recurring pattern of obsessive and likely unrequited love for Charlotte.
- Charlotte's act of changing the subject suggests a repeated dynamic where she establishes boundaries against his emotional intensity, which he seems unable to moderate.
- The feeling of being emotionally drained and powerless in her presence appears to be a recurring insight.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Increased alcohol consumption:** Using wine as a crutch.
- **Obsessive actions:** Visiting a specific spot solely because of its connection to a memory of Charlotte.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author has a clear but passive insight into his own condition. He recognizes his complete lack of emotional energy ("energies are all prostrated") and his total subservience to Charlotte's influence. It is less a moment of learning and more a declaration of surrender to his emotional state.
