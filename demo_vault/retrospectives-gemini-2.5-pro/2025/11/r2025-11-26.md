Melancholic, wretched, and distressed.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**

*   Feelings of isolation and believing one's misery is unique ("Thou alone art wretched: all other mortals are happy").

**Positive moments:**
*   Finding solace and a sense of connection through literature. Realizing that others in the past have experienced similar feelings, which helps in understanding one's own heart.

**Negative spirals:**

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
