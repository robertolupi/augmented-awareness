### 1. Key Events
The entry is a deep, internal monologue directed at someone named Wilhelm. The author rejects Wilhelm's sympathy and advice, choosing instead to remain with their suffering. There are no external events described; the entire entry focuses on an intense emotional and philosophical struggle.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

**Mood:**
Profoundly melancholic, despairing, and fatalistic. The author expresses a sense of wretchedness and hopelessness, framed in a highly articulate and dramatic manner.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
*   A feeling of being "oppressed beyond all resource" and "self-deficient."
*   The author feels they are about to "plunge into inevitable destruction," indicating extreme emotional pressure and a sense of being completely overwhelmed.
*   The rejection of help ("Leave me to my sufferings") suggests a state where the author feels beyond aid.

**Positive moments:**
None. The author actively rejects comfort and any positive framing of their situation, questioning why they should call their "cup of bitterness" sweet.

**Negative spirals:**
The entire entry is a negative spiral. It begins by pushing away support, then moves to questioning divine salvation and feeling personally excluded from it ("Have I been given to him?"). The author defines human destiny as nothing more than fulfilling a measure of suffering. This culminates in a vision of annihilation and a deep identification with Christ's cry of being forsaken by God.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
Physical health and sleep are not directly mentioned. The author does describe a future moment of intense physical sensation—"my whole being will tremble"—but this is a projection of existential terror, not a current physical symptom.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
As this is a single entry, recurring themes cannot be confirmed. However, the entry is built on powerful themes that are likely central to the author's struggles:
*   **The nature of suffering:** A belief that suffering is the inescapable destiny of man.
*   **Spiritual doubt/crisis:** Questioning one's place in religious salvation and feeling potentially forsaken by God.
*   **Isolation:** Actively pushing away support and feeling uniquely burdened, despite framing the suffering in universal terms.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Rejecting help:** The author explicitly asks Wilhelm to stop offering advice and to leave them alone with their pain.
*   **Intellectualizing despair:** The author doesn't just state their sadness; they build a complex theological and philosophical argument to justify it, comparing their suffering to that of Christ. This may be a way of validating or coping with overwhelming emotion.
*   **Expressing existential dread:** The language used ("plunge into inevitable destruction," "dissolve around me," "vanish away") is highly charged and points towards a contemplation of non-existence.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The primary insight is a dark one: an acceptance of suffering as the fundamental condition of humanity. The author learns to legitimize their own despair by seeing it as a reflection of a universal, even divine, struggle. Rather than feeling ashamed of their weakness or fear, they conclude that it is a valid response to the terrifying nature of existence, referencing that even the "God of heaven" found his cup bitter and felt fear. The learning is not a path out of suffering, but a justification for the experience of it.
