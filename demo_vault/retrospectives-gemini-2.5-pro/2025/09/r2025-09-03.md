### 1. Key Events
No specific events are detailed. The entry is a powerful emotional reaction to the author's perception that a person they love ("she") loves someone else.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Intense emotional pain, characterized by feelings of jealousy, incomprehension, and despair. The tone is deeply melancholic and verging on obsessive.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** The absolute and totalizing language ("love nothing in this world so completely," "know only her," "no other possession") indicates high emotional distress and a potential cognitive distortion where this one relationship consumes all mental focus.

**Positive moments:** None are mentioned.

**Negative spirals:** The entire entry is a single, consuming negative thought. It reveals a pattern of possessiveness and an inability to accept the loved one's autonomy, framing her love for another as a personal betrayal or an incomprehensible act.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
There is no mention of physical health or sleep.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
Without other entries, it's impossible to confirm recurrence. However, this entry establishes a powerful potential theme of unrequited love, obsessive attachment, and jealousy. If this sentiment appears elsewhere, it would signify a significant recurring emotional struggle.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
No actions are described. The notable aspect is the cognitive pattern: an obsessive and possessive line of thinking that views the loved one as a "possession" and their own identity as being entirely defined by this love.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author does not demonstrate any reflective insight. The entry is a raw, unfiltered expression of pain and bewilderment, not an analysis of the feeling or its origins. The author is fully immersed in the emotion rather than observing it.
