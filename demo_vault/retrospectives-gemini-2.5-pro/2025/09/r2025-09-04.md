### 1. Key Events
*   The author encountered a peasant boy he had previously written about, who has now been dismissed from his service.
*   The author listened to the boy's story of his intense, unrequited love for his former mistress.
*   The boy's passion escalated to the point of a physical confrontation after being rejected.
*   The mistress's brother engineered the boy's dismissal to protect a potential inheritance for his own children.
*   The boy is now an outcast, and his former mistress is considering marrying another servant, a situation the boy claims he will not survive.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Melancholic and fatalistic. The author feels an autumnal decay within himself ("My leaves are sere and yellow"). He claims to be "tranquil" but only as a temporary effect of being engrossed in writing the story. The underlying mood is one of despair and identification with tragedy.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** The author notes he is usually more "agitated," implying a constant state of high anxiety. He feels destined for sorrow ("this also is part of my destiny") and expresses a deep, overwhelming sympathy for the suffering of others, which seems to exhaust him.

**Positive moments:** The act of writing the story provides a temporary calm. The initial conversation with the peasant boy, which "interested me exceedingly," offered a moment of intense engagement.

**Negative spirals:** The author explicitly equates the peasant's tragic story with his own fate ("it is the history of your friend! My fortune has been and will be similar"). This is a clear instance of projection, where he uses another's misfortune to reinforce his own sense of hopelessness. He amplifies this by judging himself as less brave than the "poor wretch."

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   The peasant boy is described as being unable to "eat nor drink nor sleep" due to his consuming passion. The author does not comment on his own physical state.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   **Lamentation:** The author refers to his tendency to "utter eternally" his "old song," indicating a recurring pattern of complaining about his misfortune and disposition.
*   **Identification with suffering:** He explicitly states he is drawn to "every unfortunate being," suggesting this is a known and repeated pattern of behavior.
*   **Romantic fatalism:** The theme of his own romantic destiny being tragic is reinforced by seeing a parallel in the peasant's story.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Seeking out suffering:** The author deliberately sought information about the boy and then engaged him in conversation to hear his tragic story.
*   **Obsessive narration:** He focuses intently on retelling the story, writing it down, and then re-reading it. This act serves as both a coping mechanism (distraction) and a way to deepen his identification with the tragedy.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author reflects on the purity of passion among the "uneducated" class, contrasting it with his own "educated" but not "perverted" class. He demonstrates self-awareness about his emotional state, noting that the act of writing has made him less agitated. However, his primary insight is not one of growth but of reinforcement; he doesn't learn how to avoid a similar fate but concludes that his tragic destiny is sealed and mirrored in the story he has just heard.
