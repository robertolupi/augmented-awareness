### 1. Key Events
- Experienced significant conflict with an ambassador due to disagreements over work methods, leading the author to take unilateral action.
- The ambassador complained about the author at court.
- The author received a gentle reprimand from a minister, which prompted them to consider resigning.
- A subsequent letter from the same minister, described as noble and generous, persuaded the author to stay by validating their work ethic while advising moderation.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** The entry charts a course from intense frustration and indignation to a state of calm and temporary peace. The initial feelings of being undermined gave way to a sense of validation after receiving the minister's letter.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
- High-stakes conflict with a superior ("growing past endurance").
- Feeling compelled to work against official protocol.
- Receiving a formal reprimand.
- An impulsive desire to resign from a high-stress situation.

**Positive moments:**
- Receiving the thoughtful and validating letter from the minister.
- The feeling of being understood and having one's "youthful ardour" and sense of duty acknowledged as a positive trait.
- Achieving a state of being "at rest for another week" and "no longer at variance with myself."

**Negative spirals:**
- The dynamic with the ambassador created a negative loop: disagreement -> author's contradictory action -> ambassador's complaint -> official reprimand. This spiral was only broken by the minister's intervention.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep
- Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes
- While not explicitly linked to past entries, the author's final reflection on "content and peace of mind" being "transitory" suggests a recurring struggle to maintain emotional stability. The tension between the author's passionate idealism ("youthful ardour") and the need for diplomatic moderation appears to be a core personal conflict.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Impulsive Reaction:** The immediate decision to tender a resignation after a "gentle" reprimand highlights a high degree of sensitivity and a strong attachment to personal principles.
- **Insubordination:** The author knowingly contradicts their superior and does "things my own way," indicating a strong conviction in their own judgment, even at the risk of professional censure.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
- The author gained the insight that their intense dedication and "ardour," while valuable, need to be moderated to be effective and productive. They learned that their intentions are seen and valued, but their approach requires refinement. The entry ends with a meta-cognitive observation about the fleeting nature of positive emotional states, recognizing that the current peace is precious but likely temporary.
