### 1. Key Events
The author was visiting Charlotte while she played the piano. Seeing her wedding ring caused him to cry. She then played a familiar, meaningful song which, instead of comforting him, triggered intense memories of past sorrows and disappointments. Overwhelmed, he paced the room before demanding she stop playing. Charlotte observed his distress, told him he was "ill," and advised him to compose himself. The author then abruptly left in a state of torment.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

*   **Mood:** Despairing, tormented, melancholic, and emotionally overwhelmed. The author feels he is at a breaking point.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** The entry begins with "I can support this state no longer," indicating a complete emotional collapse. His heart is described as "convulsed with painful emotions," and he is unable to regulate his reaction to the music.
*   **Positive moments:** There was a brief, fleeting moment of comfort from the "recollection of the past" triggered by the music before it turned painful.
*   **Negative spirals:** A powerful negative spiral was initiated by the sight of Charlotte's wedding ring. This was amplified by the familiar song, which plunged him into a cycle of painful memories and culminated in an emotional and physical outburst, ending with a desperate plea to God.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
Charlotte directly tells the author, "Werther, you are ill." This is an external observation of his profound distress, which is manifesting as a form of illness, though no specific physical symptoms are detailed.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
Based on this entry alone, the key themes are:
*   **Unrequited Love:** The author's intense emotional pain is centered on Charlotte, specifically symbolized by her wedding ring, which represents her unavailability.
*   **The Pain of Memory:** A song that once brought joy is now a source of torment, illustrating how positive memories have become tainted by current suffering and loss.
*   **Emotional Overwhelm:** The author demonstrates a pattern of being completely overwhelmed by emotional triggers, leading to a loss of composure.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Emotional Dysregulation:** The author weeps uncontrollably in response to seeing the wedding ring and hearing the song.
*   **Physical Agitation:** He "paced with hasty strides through the room" as a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil.
*   **Abrupt Withdrawal:** He "tore myself away" from the situation, showing a flight response when overwhelmed rather than an ability to self-soothe or manage the situation.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author recognizes the depth of his suffering ("God, thou seest my torments") and acknowledges he has reached a limit ("I can support this state no longer"). However, there is no insight into how to manage or change his state. The reflection is one of pure despair, looking for an external force (God) to "end" his torment, rather than finding any internal capacity for coping.
