### 1. Key Events
*   The author is internally consumed by the image of a woman, which dominates their thoughts whether awake or asleep.
*   The entry consists of a deep, philosophical rumination on human limitations and the futility of existence.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
*   **Mood:** Melancholic, obsessive, despairing, and fatalistic.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** A sense of powerlessness ("powers fail when he most requires their use") and existential dread. The feeling of being mentally overwhelmed ("absorb my senses") suggests intense emotional strain.
*   **Positive moments:** None. Even the mention of soaring "in joy" is framed as a temporary state that is "inevitably arrested."
*   **Negative spirals:** The entire entry is a negative thought spiral. It begins with an intense obsession over a woman's image and expands into a bleak, nihilistic worldview where all human aspiration is pointless and leads back to a "cold, monotonous existence."

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   Sleep is mentioned as being disturbed by the obsessive thoughts ("Waking or asleep, she fills my entire soul!"). Closing their eyes does not bring rest but instead conjures the haunting image more vividly.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   No links to other entries are provided. Based on this entry alone, the central themes are romantic obsession and existential despair. If this were a recurring pattern, it would point to a repeated struggle with these intense feelings and philosophical crises.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   The primary behavior is intense mental rumination. The author is caught in a compulsive loop of thinking about this person, unable to escape the image even by closing their eyes.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
*   The author engages in deep reflection on their internal state and the human condition. The insight reached is a pessimistic one: that humanity is not a "boasted demigod," and our aspirations are ultimately futile. They recognize the disconnect between dreaming of "grasping at infinity" and the reality of a "cold, monotonous existence." The author is highly aware of their own mental process but seems to have learned only that escape or transcendence is impossible.
