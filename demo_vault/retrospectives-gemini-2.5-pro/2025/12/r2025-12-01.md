### 1. Key Events
- The author learned the backstory of a man named Wilhelm, who was previously the secretary to Charlotte's father.
- Wilhelm was dismissed after his secret and unhappy passion for Charlotte was discovered.
- The author notes that this dismissal drove Wilhelm "mad."
- The story was related to the author by Albert, who remained calm during the telling.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Highly agitated and deeply disturbed. The author is intensely preoccupied with Wilhelm's story, contrasting their own strong emotional reaction with Albert's calmness.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** High emotional distress and obsessive focus on a tragic narrative. The author's fixation on Wilhelm's fate indicates a significant mental burden.

**Positive moments:** None are mentioned in this entry.

**Negative spirals:** The author seems to be identifying strongly with Wilhelm's tragic fate, calling him "enviable in his misfortunes." This suggests a romanticization of suffering and a potential spiral into seeing their own situation through this dark lens. The intense reaction to the story points to a deep-seated personal anxiety about unrequited love and its consequences.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep
- Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes
- The entry explicitly refers to a previous entry about Wilhelm ("the man about whom I wrote to you"), establishing his story as a recurring point of fixation.
- The theme of unrequited love and its devastating potential is central. The mention of Charlotte and Albert suggests a recurring love triangle dynamic that is a source of tension for the author.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Romanticizing tragedy:** The author describes Wilhelm as "enviable in his misfortunes," which is a notable and concerning tendency to glamorize pain and suffering born from passion.
- **Obsessive rumination:** The author is fixated on the story, contrasting their emotional turmoil with Albert's detachment. This highlights a pattern of internalizing and amplifying negative narratives that resonate with their own emotional state.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author has gained a specific understanding of Wilhelm's tragic history. The main insight is self-referential: the author is acutely aware of how deeply the story has affected them ("what an impression the circumstance has made upon me!"). By noting Albert's calmness, the author is reflecting on their own heightened emotional sensitivity and personal connection to the subject matter.
