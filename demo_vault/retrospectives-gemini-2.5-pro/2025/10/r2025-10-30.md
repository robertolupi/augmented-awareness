### 1. Key Events
*   The author is experiencing intense, repeated urges to embrace a specific person ("her").
*   They are observing this person frequently ("passing and repassing").
*   Crucially, the author is restraining themselves from acting on this impulse.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Tormented, yearning, and deeply frustrated. There is a strong sense of longing mixed with the pain of inaction.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** The language used ("torment," "one hundred times") points to significant emotional distress and obsessive thinking around this person and the unfulfilled desire.

**Positive moments:** The appreciation of the person's "loveliness" is the source of the positive feeling, even though it fuels the negative ones.

**Negative spirals:** The entry describes a cycle of seeing the person, feeling an intense desire to act, suppressing that desire, and then feeling tormented by the restraint. This appears to be a fixation causing significant mental anguish.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   While no other entries are linked, the theme is one of intense, unrequited, or forbidden desire. It highlights a powerful internal conflict between a natural instinct and the conscious decision to not act on it.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Forced Restraint:** The primary behavior is actively not doing somethingâ€”not "laying hold" of the person they desire. This demonstrates a powerful struggle with self-control.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
*   The author reflects on the nature of human instinct, comparing their urge to a child's simple, natural impulse to touch what they see. The insight is that suppressing this fundamental drive is the source of their "torment." They recognize their inaction as being contrary to a natural law, which amplifies their feeling of suffering and helplessness.
