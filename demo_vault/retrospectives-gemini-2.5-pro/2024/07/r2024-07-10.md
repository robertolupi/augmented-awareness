### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:**
Intense, passionate, and exasperated. The author is experiencing a powerful emotional state that feels misunderstood by others.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
Social interactions revolving around this specific topic ("Charlotte") are a significant source of stress, causing the author to feel foolish and flustered.

**Positive moments:**
The entry centers on an all-consuming, profound affection for "Charlotte," which is a powerful and deeply felt emotion.

**Negative spirals:**
The author gets stuck on the phrase "like her," detesting its inadequacy. This triggers a spiral of frustration over the inability of common language to capture the depth of their feelings, making them feel isolated. The comparison to being asked if one "likes" Ossian (epic poetry) highlights how reductive the question feels.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
The entry points to a powerful and perhaps all-consuming romantic attachment as a central theme. The intensity suggests this is a recurring subject of thought, causing both profound feeling and social friction. A potential recurring pattern is the struggle to articulate deep emotions and feeling misunderstood by others.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Intense internal reaction to social questioning:** The author has a very strong, negative internal response to a seemingly simple social question.
- **Feeling self-conscious:** Reports feeling foolish in company when the subject of their affection is mentioned.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author has a clear insight into the sheer scale of their feelings, recognizing that they go far beyond simple "liking." The core reflection is on the limitations of language; the author is acutely aware that the words available to them are completely insufficient to describe their emotional reality to others.
