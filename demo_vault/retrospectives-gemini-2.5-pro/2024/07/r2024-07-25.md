### 1. Key Events
The entry uses a literary quote to describe an implied event: receiving a highly anticipated letter or message from a significant person ("Charlotte"). The author expresses a deep desire for more connection and communication from this person.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

*   **Mood:** Intensely romantic, devoted, and longing. There is a sense of passionate servitude and a desire to please the other person. The mood is also one of heightened sensitivity.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** The enthusiastic request for more "commissions" ("the more the better") could suggest a people-pleasing tendency or a desire for validation that might lead to burnout if unchecked.
*   **Positive moments:** The act of receiving the letter is clearly a moment of joy and excitement, highlighted by the impulsive gesture of raising it "hastily to my lips."
*   **Negative spirals:** The quote is from "The Sorrows of Young Werther," a character known for obsessive love and a tragic end. Using this quote could hint at an awareness of a potentially unhealthy or obsessive emotional dynamic. The extreme physical reaction to a minor annoyance ("it set my teeth on edge") suggests a state of overstimulation where small things feel disproportionately jarring.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
A specific and strong sensory reaction is noted: the feeling of writing-sand setting the author's teeth on edge. This points to a state of heightened physical and emotional sensitivity.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
Cannot be determined from a single entry. This entry establishes a theme of intense, romantic devotion and sensitivity.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Passionate Gestures:** The act of kissing the letter demonstrates impulsive, romantic, and deeply affectionate behavior.
*   **Service-Oriented Devotion:** The author expresses a strong desire to be given tasks or "commissions" by the other person, framing service as a form of connection.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author seems to be reflecting on the dual nature of their intense affection. While they crave connection and are eager to serve, they are also so sensitive that minor physical details can be upsetting. The request to "use no more writing-sand" is a gentle form of setting a boundary, showing an awareness that even within this deep devotion, their own sensory needs must be communicated.
