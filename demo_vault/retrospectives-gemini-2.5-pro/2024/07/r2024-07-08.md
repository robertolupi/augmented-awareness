### 1. Key Events
- The author went on an outing to Walheim with a group that included "Charlotte."
- While saying goodbye, the author felt ignored by Charlotte, who was interacting with others.
- As the carriage departed, Charlotte looked back out the window, leaving the author to wonder if the glance was for them.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Melancholic and intensely emotional, oscillating between feelings of despair/invisibility and fragile hope.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** High emotional dependency on external validation (a look from Charlotte). The author's mood is extremely volatile and contingent on another person's perceived actions.

**Positive moments:** The brief moment of consolation and hope found in the uncertainty of Charlotte's backward glance ("Perhaps she turned to look at me. Perhaps!").

**Negative spirals:** The author felt completely overlooked ("they did not light on me, on me"), leading to a feeling of deep sadness and near-despair ("My heart bade her a thousand times adieu... my eyes filled with tears"). This is punctuated by self-critical thoughts like "I am a fool" and "what a child I am!"

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
- The author notes feeling very tired: "my own eyes are weighed down with sleep."

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
- No links to previous entries are mentioned. The entry is self-contained.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Hyper-fixation:** The author's attention is entirely consumed by Charlotte, analyzing her every glance and lack thereof ("who saw nothing but her!").
- **Rumination:** The author is caught in a loop of replaying the final moments, obsessing over the meaning of an ambiguous gesture.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author shows self-awareness about the irrationality and immaturity of their intense feelings, repeatedly calling themselves "a child" and "a fool." However, this insight doesn't seem to lessen the emotional impact; it's more of a lament about their own nature than a step toward changing it.
