### 1. Key Events
*   The author confessed to neglecting their drawing practice.
*   They attempted to draw a portrait of "Charlotte" three times, failing each time.
*   As a compromise, they sketched her profile instead.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

*   **Mood**: A state of paradox. The author reports feeling intensely happy and deeply connected with nature ("I never felt happier, I never understood nature better"). However, this is paired with intense creative frustration and feelings of inadequacy ("disgraced myself").
*   **Stress/Burnout markers**: A significant creative block. The author feels their "powers of execution are so weak" and cannot create a "clear, bold outline," despite having a strong vision. This disconnect between perception and execution is a source of annoyance and stress.
*   **Positive moments**: A profound and joyful appreciation for nature, down to the smallest detail.
*   **Negative spirals**: The repeated failures at drawing Charlotte's portrait created a cycle of frustration, especially when contrasted with their memory of being good at it in the past.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   The entry points to a recurring struggle with creative practice. The author notes they have "lately done" very little drawing and that their skill in capturing likenesses has declined from what it "formerly" was. This suggests an ongoing pattern of artistic block.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Adaptive Persistence**: After failing at the main portrait, the author adapted by creating a simpler profile sketch rather than giving up completely.
*   **Creative Problem-Solving**: The author considers switching their artistic medium from drawing to modeling with clay or wax as a potential solution to their creative block.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
*   The author has a clear meta-cognitive awareness of their state. They have identified the specific problem: it is not a lack of vision or feeling (which are stronger than ever) but a failure in execution. They learned that their frustration stems from this gap between their internal world and their ability to express it externally. Their hypothesis that a different, more tactile medium might be the solution is a key insight.
