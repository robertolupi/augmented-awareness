### 1. Key Events
- Albert, the betrothed of Charlotte, has arrived.
- The author feels his time with Charlotte is now over and that he must leave.
- The author acknowledges Albert's good character but finds his presence unbearable.
- He has started actively avoiding seeing Charlotte when Albert is with her.
- Charlotte has confronted the author about his "violent" and extravagant behavior, asking him to stop.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

**Mood:** Despairing, tormented, and volatile. The author swings between grudging admiration for his rival and profound heartbreak and jealousy.

**Stress/Burnout markers:** High levels of emotional distress are evident. The author feels his joy is "over" and describes his heart as being near-broken. He reacts with "infinite scorn" to suggestions of resignation, indicating an inability to cope with the situation.

**Positive moments:**
- Acknowledges Albert's good qualities, calling him a "fine, worthy fellow" and noting he must love him for the respect he shows Charlotte.
- Experiences a feeling of being "delighted" when he occasionally finds Charlotte alone.

**Negative spirals:**
- The author is caught in a spiral of self-aware despair. He knows he had no claim to Charlotte but is still emotionally devastated by the reality of her betrothed's arrival.
- He dismisses logical advice and resorts to what Charlotte calls "violent" behavior and "extravagances," indicating a loss of emotional control when confronted with the couple.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
Not mentioned in this entry.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
Based on the intensity of this entry, the following are strong potential recurring themes:
- **Unrequited Love:** The core of the author's struggle is his passionate, yet impossible, love for the engaged Charlotte.
- **Emotional Volatility:** The author explicitly contrasts his own "impetuosity" with Albert's "coolness," highlighting a recurring internal battle with his own intense emotions.
- **Rivalry and Jealousy:** The dynamic with Albert is a central themeâ€”a mixture of esteem, jealousy, and torment.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
- **Avoidance:** "I am always away now when he visits her." The author is actively avoiding the source of his pain.
- **Impulsive Outbursts:** Described by himself as behaving "like a fool" and committing "extravagances." Charlotte's plea confirms his behavior is alarming.
- **Physical Manifestation of Stress:** "I bite my lips" in frustration and scorn.
- **Escapism:** He rambles through the woods, likely as a way to process or escape his turmoil.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author demonstrates significant self-awareness but is powerless against his emotions. He recognizes that his despair is illogical ("Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now") but cannot stop feeling it. The key insight is a painful one: intellectual understanding of a situation provides no defense against emotional devastation. He has learned the finality of his loss ("my pleasure with Charlotte is over") but has not learned how to cope with it.
