### 1. Key Events
*   Experiencing accidental physical contact (touching fingers, feet under the table) with a woman he is infatuated with.
*   The woman placing her hand on his during an earnest conversation.
*   Hearing her play a specific, simple melody on the piano, which he describes as her favorite.
*   Her singing this same song at times when he feels desperate.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Highly volatile and intense, oscillating between agony and ecstasy. The author's emotional state is entirely dependent on his proximity to and interaction with one person.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
*   Describes his senses becoming "disordered" from minor physical contact.
*   Reports extreme emotional and physiological reactions, feeling as if "lightning had struck."
*   Mentions suicidal ideation, stating he is sometimes "ready to commit suicide."

**Positive moments:**
*   Being in her presence is described as sacred, stilling all passion and making his "soul beat in every nerve."
*   Hearing her play or sing a specific melody provides immediate and profound relief, causing "all pain, care, and sorrow" to disappear and dispersing "gloom and madness."

**Negative spirals:**
*   Minor, innocent physical contact from her inflicts "agony."
*   He experiences a powerful internal conflict between his intense attraction ("a secret force impels me forward") and his self-perceived moral failings ("my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak"). This weakness is questioned as a form of "corruption."

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep
*   **Physical Health:** The author reports intense physiological reactions to emotional stimuli: a racing heart, drawing back from touch "as if from a furnace," and feeling his soul "beat in every nerve." These are strong psychosomatic responses.
*   **Sleep:** Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes
*   No other entries are provided, but themes within this entry suggest recurring patterns:
    *   **Obsessive Infatuation:** The author's entire emotional world revolves around one person, who he sees as a "sacred being."
    *   **The Agony of Unexpressed Desire:** A repeated struggle between intense physical and emotional attraction and a sense of moral restraint or weakness.
    *   **Music as a Lifeline:** Her specific song is a recurring external tool that consistently pulls him back from despair and suicidal thoughts.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Avoidance/Attraction Conflict:** Physically recoiling from her touch ("I draw back as if from a furnace") despite a powerful internal force compelling him forward.
*   **Emotional Dependency:** Relying on her presence and her music as the sole mechanism for regulating extreme emotional states, particularly suicidal ideation.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author is acutely aware of his internal state and the conflict within him. He recognizes that her actions are "innocent" and "unconscious," and the turmoil is entirely his own. He questions his own character, wondering if his profound weakness is a form of corruption. He also reflects on the power of music, connecting his personal experience to historical beliefs about "the magic of ancient music." He has insight into his condition but feels powerless to change it.
