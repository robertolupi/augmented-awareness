### 1. Key Events
*   The author describes a repeated, failed attempt to keep a resolution to see a specific person ("her") less frequently.
*   Despite vowing each day to stay away, the author finds an "irresistible reason" to see her, such as a direct invitation, an errand, or simply being in the vicinity.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
*   **Mood:** A state of intense infatuation and obsession, marked by a feeling of powerlessness against the temptation to see someone. The tone is one of romantic helplessness.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** There is significant internal conflict between the rational desire to stay away and the emotional compulsion to be near her. The loadstone mountain metaphor suggests an awareness of this attraction as being potentially destructive.
*   **Positive moments:** The act of being with her is presented as the primary driver of behavior, the "irresistible" temptation that overrides all resolutions.
*   **Negative spirals:** The entry describes a classic negative feedback loop: making a promise, breaking it due to overwhelming temptation, and likely feeling guilty or powerless, only to repeat the cycle the next day. The metaphor of the ship being pulled apart suggests a fear of complete self-destruction.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep
*   Not mentioned.

### 4. Recurring Themes
*   The entry explicitly details a recurring pattern of behavior: the struggle between self-control and an overwhelming emotional pull towards another person. The daily failure to keep the resolution is the central theme.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
*   **Compulsive action:** The author feels compelled to see this person daily, despite their better judgment.
*   **Rationalization:** The author actively seeks or creates justifications ("irresistible reason") to break their own rules, such as needing to deliver an answer in person or happening to be nearby.
*   **Lack of Self-Control:** The entry is a direct confession of an inability to control one's actions when faced with the "charmed atmosphere" surrounding this person.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
*   The author demonstrates a high degree of self-awareness regarding their lack of control and the potentially harmful nature of their obsession. The analogy of the loadstone mountain is a powerful piece of meta-cognition, showing they understand this attraction as a force that could metaphorically pull them apart and lead to their "undoing." The insight is in clearly identifying the destructive pattern, even if they feel unable to stop it.
