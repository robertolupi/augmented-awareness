# r2024-W31

1. **Weekly Highlights & Stressors**
    - **Highlight:** The only fleeting moments of joy this week came from the rare instances of finding Charlotte alone, a stark contrast to the week's overarching emotional tone.
    - **Stressor:** The arrival of Albert, Charlotte's betrothed, has been the primary and overwhelming stressor. His presence has shattered the narrator's emotional world, transforming a known reality into an unbearable, daily torment. Charlotte's confrontation about the narrator's "violent" behavior has added a layer of external pressure and shame to his internal turmoil.

2. **Changes in Mood or Energy**
    - The week was defined by a sharp, negative shift in mood from whatever existed before Albert's arrival to a state of constant despair and torment. Energy seems to have been channeled into volatile, impulsive actions and avoidance behaviors. The mood trajectory is a steep decline into heartbreak, characterized by swings between grudging respect for a rival and profound jealousy.

3. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**
    - **Mental Health:** Mental health is in a state of crisis. The narrator is experiencing high levels of emotional distress, describing himself as heartbroken and tormented. He is caught in a negative spiral of self-aware despair, unable to reconcile his logical understanding of the situation with his overwhelming emotional pain. His reactions are extreme, indicating a loss of emotional regulation.
    - **Physical Health:** While not explicitly detailed, physical manifestations of stress are present, such as biting his lips in frustration. His "violent" outbursts and rambling through the woods suggest a physical restlessness driven by mental anguish.

4. **Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns**
    - A clear pattern of **avoidance** has been established. The narrator is now actively avoiding social situations involving both Charlotte and Albert, a behavior he has consciously adopted to manage (or rather, escape) his pain. This is paired with a pattern of **compulsive emotional outbursts** or "extravagances" when avoidance fails, suggesting a reactive cycle of escape and explosion.

5. **Meaningful Actions or Decisions**
    - The most significant decision of the week was to actively withdraw from Charlotte's company whenever Albert is present. This is a deliberate, albeit painful, strategy to cope. It signifies a turning point where the narrator moves from passively enjoying Charlotte's company to actively managing his exposure to heartbreak.

6. **Emerging Themes (from tags or links)**
    - The week's events have crystallized the central themes of **unrequited love** and **jealousy**. The dynamic with Albert introduces a powerful theme of **rivalry**, which is complex due to the narrator's simultaneous respect and resentment. The resulting **emotional turmoil** and **heartbreak** are the dominant experiences, defining every interaction and internal thought.
