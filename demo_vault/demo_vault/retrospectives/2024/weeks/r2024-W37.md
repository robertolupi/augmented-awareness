1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Werther spent the week (single-day record) in intense romantic mourning: a moonlit meeting with Charlotte and Albert brought acute longing, weeping, and a resolved plan to depart at sunrise. Major stressors: separation, memories of the dying mother’s charge, and a foreboding sense of finality.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense agitation, melancholy, restlessness, tremulous longing and frequent tears (high intensity).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping Strategies: emotional expression (weeping), physical movement (walking/pacing/running), seeking solitude in favored landscapes, verbal confession.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: acknowledges courage for concealing intention; prompts present in notes — what would make departure feel less final, how to honor promises without being consumed, how to use comforting places to process grief.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: repeated visits to the same romantic spot (terrace/avenue/recess), pacing and dramatic physical gestures, open emotional release. No regular daily routines listed.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood remained predominantly low and high‑intensity sorrowful throughout the documented period, peaking during the moonlit encounter and settling into a resolved but uneasy calm toward planned departure.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight trends: Not specified. Mentions of temporal metrics verbatim: "two hours' duration"; "half an hour"; "six months"; "tomorrow"; plan "at sunrise the horses are to be at the door."

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination episodes; the author deliberately conceals his intention during the meeting and expresses ambivalence about keeping his word ("perhaps I may not keep my word").

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: resolved to depart at sunrise; declared belief in future reunion; maintained silence about true intentions during meeting. Completed tasks: none recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) The romanticized landscape and moonlight amplify grief and longing. 2) A tension between resolute departure and lingering attachment to relationships and promises.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Depart at sunrise — planned (horses at the door).  
- Not betray intention in meeting — acted upon (stated courage).  
- Charlotte’s charge to care for siblings — noted as future obligation (Charlotte’s commitment). Gaps: no confirmation of departure or follow‑through beyond intent.
