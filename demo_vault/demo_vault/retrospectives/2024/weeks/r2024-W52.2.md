# r2024-W52

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The recorded day shows loyalty and social curiosity (defending Count C—; interest in Miss B—) alongside sustained frustration with an ambassador’s pedantry that blocked business and provoked impatience.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: annoyance, indignation, contempt, weariness, agitation, impatience (explicit).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: "the folly of judging of others by ourselves" (explicit).  
• Coping Strategies: defending a friend; leaving a meeting to avoid escalating anger; restraint in expectation of reciprocal freedom.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit awareness of judgmental tendency and an intention to permit others’ courses; week‑level generalizations are limited by single‑day data *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: critical observation of others, defending valued acquaintances, withdrawing to prevent anger. One‑offs: requesting a visit to Miss B— and awaiting permission; no recorded task completions.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
On the recorded day mood remained agitated, impatient and contemptuous with moments of deliberate restraint; broader weekly trajectory cannot be established from this single entry *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Mental: heightened agitation and weariness noted. Physical metrics (sleep, activity, weight, sleep scores): Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance observed as deliberate withdrawal from a meeting to prevent anger escalation; no tasks completed in the entry, suggesting stalled administrative progress.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions taken: defended Count C— publicly; left a meeting to avoid escalation; requested a visit to Miss B—. Accomplishments: social/relational actions and self‑restraint; no business completions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Two threads: obstructive pedantry and social pretension provoke irritation; loyalty and deliberate restraint steer interpersonal responses.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: leave when anger risks escalation (follow‑through: yes — left meeting); allow others freedom (intent stated; not yet demonstrably tested); visit Miss B— (requested; awaiting); aim to work "regularly and cheerfully" and finish promptly (stated; no evidence of enactment).
