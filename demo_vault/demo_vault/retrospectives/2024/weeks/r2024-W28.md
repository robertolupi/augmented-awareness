# r2024-W28

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Moments of perceived affection and self‑honoring awareness (belief in love, “I may believe my own heart”) coexist with persistent yearning, social embarrassment, and preoccupation with another’s illness and household secrecy. Major stressors: unrequited longing, self‑reproach, and awareness of others’ suffering/financial concealment.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: tearful yearning (07‑08), consuming absorption and embarrassment (07‑10), concern/prayer for the ill (07‑11), exaltation mixed with doubt (07‑13).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑labeling (“I am a fool”), all‑or‑nothing thinking about feelings, presumption vs. reality tension.  
• Coping Strategies: introspection, seeking consolation in uncertainty, prayer and visiting the ill, verbal self‑affirmation (“believe my own heart”).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompts to reframe self‑judgment and practice self‑forgiveness appear; consider concrete self‑compassion practices next week *(inferred)*.  
• Data gaps: entries for 2024‑07‑09 and 2024‑07‑12 are missing; this limits continuity in mood/behavior patterns *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent introspection and visual focus on Charlotte, social withdrawal when embarrassed, occasional visits and prayer for Madame M—, and repeated reporting of no completed tasks (✓0/0).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood flows from tearful longing to intense absorption and social awkwardness, dips into caregiving concern, then rises to exaltation tempered by doubt — overall emotionally volatile across entries *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: single mention of heavy sleepiness (07‑08); otherwise Not specified. Activity/weight/metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Multiple entries show “0/0 tasks completed” (explicit); this repeated lack of recorded task completion may reflect missed follow‑through or avoidance *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Stated continuance of prayer and occasional visits to Madame M— (explicit); a personal decision to “believe my own heart” is declared (explicit). No other task completions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Romantic absorption vs. social self‑consciousness. 2) Witnessing others’ hardship and secrecy (illness + hidden household finances) alongside personal emotional turmoil.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Continue praying/visiting Madame M—: described and practiced (explicit).  
- Believe his own heart: declared (explicit).  
- General task completion: consistently absent — gap in follow‑through.
