1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was marked by profound engagement with human character and emotion. A significant highlight was a visit to the Vicar of Sâ€”, which, despite leading to an intense emotional reaction for the author, also provided deep philosophical discussion and invaluable guidance from Charlotte. Observing Charlotte's compassionate nature and her ability to uplift others was a consistent positive. Later in the week, a serene moment at a spring with Charlotte and her sisters reinforced the author's deep admiration for her. The primary stressors included Charlotte's initial absence, the observed "ill-humour" of Herr Schmidt that triggered a powerful emotional memory, and the subsequent internal distress that led to withdrawal. A minor stressor was encountering a rationalistic viewpoint that challenged the author's personal philosophy, though this was quickly resolved internally.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began with a mood of deep longing and suffering due to Charlotte's absence, quickly shifting to intense annoyance and indignation when confronting "ill-humour." This led to a peak of emotional volatility, marked by passion, tears, and distress. However, Charlotte's gentle guidance helped to temper this intensity, leading to an acknowledged need for self-preservation. Later in the week, the mood was predominantly one of profound admiration and reverence for Charlotte, accompanied by a reflective melancholy about a past "free" state. While a brief moment of perplexity arose, the author quickly settled into a strong conviction regarding personal philosophical truths. Overall, the week saw a trajectory from emotional turmoil and high sensitivity towards a more grounded and internally resolved state, deeply influenced by Charlotte's presence.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mentally, the author exhibited high emotional sensitivity and vulnerability, prone to intense reactions and prolonged intellectual engagement that could lead to distress. There was a notable moment of emotional breakdown triggered by a past memory. However, a significant positive trend was the author's growing self-awareness, acknowledging Charlotte's advice to "spare myself" and recognizing a tendency towards emotional over-engagement. Charlotte consistently served as a mental health anchor, providing calm, wisdom, and nurturing influence. Physical health was not directly mentioned, though observations from others highlighted the interconnectedness of mind and body.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
The author demonstrated a compulsive pattern of intense observation and intellectual analysis of human character, leading to impassioned and lengthy monologues during discussions. There was also a recurring tendency to express strong emotions impulsively, such as the public display of weeping or the spontaneous kiss given to a child. The author actively sought Charlotte's presence, indicating a reliance on her for emotional grounding. The only clear avoidant behavior noted was withdrawing from a distressing situation (leaving the room after an emotional breakdown).

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
Meaningful actions included engaging in deep philosophical debates on human nature and the destructive aspects of "ill-humour," leading to a clear articulation of its origins. A crucial internal decision was seemingly accepting Charlotte's advice to manage emotional over-engagement and "spare myself." The author also made an impulsive, affectionate gesture (kissing a child) that, while initially misconstrued, led to a deeper reflection on the value of "innocent delusions." Later, the author silently and firmly maintained personal convictions despite external criticism, highlighting an internal locus of truth.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The overarching theme of the week revolved around the author's profound emotional landscape and intellectual inquiry into human nature. Charlotte emerged as a consistent and central figure, acting as a source of emotional support, wisdom, and a grounding influence. The author's high emotional sensitivity and vulnerability were repeatedly highlighted, alongside a growing self-awareness of personal tendencies towards intense engagement. A significant philosophical theme explored the tension between strict rationalism and the value of "innocent delusions" or emotional truths, particularly in fostering happiness. The "Augmented Awareness" (#aww) project resonated through the deep reflection on human behaviour and self-understanding.
