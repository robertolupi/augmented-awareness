# r2024-W27

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two clear highs: tender domestic moments around Charlotte (comforting, spring visit, defended innocence) and a passionate moral speech about ill‑humour; main stressor: intense emotional distress and tears linked to confrontation with ill‑humour and personal over‑engagement.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: sadness/longing with strong crying on 2024‑07‑01; charmed/reverent and pleased on 2024‑07‑06.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: tendency to “complain...with very little cause” (noted); framing ill‑humour as envy/self‑discontent (presented as cause).  
• Coping Strategies: Charlotte’s consolation (hum, garden walks); narrator recommends activity/exertion; storytelling and defending convictions in conversation.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: resolved to “spare” oneself for Charlotte’s sake; prompts — identify small actions to self‑soothe and concrete remedies for ill‑humour.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent attention to small domestic/natural rituals (visits to the fountain, walks), consoling behaviors from Charlotte, storytelling as processing; affectionate but sometimes boundary‑crossing physical contact (kiss with child) corrected socially.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood appears to move from acute sorrow/overwhelm (tears) toward charm and reverence across the two entries *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Physical activity: walking noted; use of spring/fountain. Numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Both entries show zero completed tasks; lack of task completion is documented. Interpreting this as avoidance of actionable tasks is plausible *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Spoke passionately about harms of ill‑humour; openly wept and accepted Charlotte’s admonition to spare himself; defended belief in preserving innocent delusions for children in a social exchange.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: Charlotte’s consoling, stabilizing influence. Secondary thread: tension between ill‑humour (distress) and remedial action (activity, consolation).

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Committed to “spare” oneself and to seek remedies for ill‑humour; no explicit evidence these commitments were enacted in the provided entries *(inferred)*.
