# r2024-W18

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A single-day snapshot showing relief after leaving a close companion, simultaneous guilt about causing another’s pain, and comfort found in solitude and nature; main stressors are rumination and lingering attachment conflicts.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: mixed — relief/happiness, affection, remorse, solace in nature (intensity not specified).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: rumination and repetitive recall of past sorrow.  
• Coping Strategies: deliberate resolve to stop ruminating, seeking solitude outdoors, engaging family (aunt, mother), emotional expression (tears).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: intent to live in the present; questions aimed at interrupting rumination and balancing kindness with boundaries.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: habitual rumination, turning to solitude/nature for comfort, taking concrete steps on family matters (meeting aunt, planning to inform mother), emotional catharsis through tears; gardener’s growing attachment noted.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single-day flow: relief → guilt/torment → calm/solace in nature; insufficient data for a multi-day trajectory (other days not provided).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit task procrastination recorded; persistent rumination replaces present engagement at times *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: left a companion; resolved to stop ruminating; agreed to attend to mother’s business; accepted/encouraged aunt’s intervention on the portion dispute. Completed tasks: none explicitly recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Rumination vs. a deliberate turn toward present‑moment living. 2) Nature/solitude as a restorative practice paired with practical family engagement.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Commitments: stop rumination (intent only, no evidence of sustained follow‑through), inform and assist mother (steps planned), accept/coordinate aunt’s terms (action initiated/accepted).
