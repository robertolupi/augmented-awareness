# r2024-W24

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A single-day snapshot: intense romantic elation and public emotional overwhelm at a ball, contrasted by the stress of learning Charlotte is engaged. Social grace (comforting children, leading a calming game) tempered moments of impulsivity and tearful idealization.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: elation → infatuation → agitation → weeping; high intensity.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: idealization *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: organizing a game to soothe others, offering comfort and attentiveness.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: acknowledges poor narration and emotional exposure; prompt — allow space to process feelings before acting.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent social poise (feeding children, leading activities) and repeated impulsive urges to leave/ride out (multiple near‑attempts). No routine practices (meditation, exercise, pomodoro) reported.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day flow: rapid rise to infatuation and intense emotional expression, punctuated by agitation and tearful release; insufficient week‑long data to establish a trend.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise metrics: Not specified. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination noted; pattern centers on impulsivity and breaking one’s own restraint (vowed not to ride yet repeatedly nearly leaving).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: vowed that any maiden he loved would not waltz with another; vowed (earlier that morning) not to ride out. Event: learned Charlotte is engaged to Albert. Completed tasks: none.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: romantic idealization vs. social/ethical boundary (her engagement); dance as a symbolic claim of intimacy and storms as catalysts for heightened emotion.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: exclusive‑waltz vow (stated, not enacted); to give a fuller account of acquaintance (intended, not yet delivered). Gap: repeated near‑departures suggest commitment friction.
