# r2024-W31

1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was dominated by the profound stress of Albert's arrival, intensifying the author's unrequited love for Charlotte. A major highlight, albeit brief, was finding Charlotte alone, providing moments of fleeting delight. The primary stressors were the constant presence of his rival, Albert, and Charlotte's direct confrontation regarding the author's "violent scenes," highlighting the negative impact of his emotional outbursts.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
Mood remained consistently highly distressed, marked by deep jealousy, despair, and self-reproach. The author experienced significant emotional volatility, swinging between intense anguish and brief moments of conflicted esteem for Albert, or delight when alone with Charlotte. Energy levels appeared high, fueling "extravagances" and leading to rambling walks as an escape, yet likely culminating in emotional exhaustion due to the constant internal turmoil.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health was severely impacted by extreme emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and profound jealousy. The author struggled with an inability to accept his situation despite rational understanding, leading to a pattern of self-defeating behaviors. Physically, the only noted manifestation of stress was "biting lips," indicating a strong psychosomatic response to his emotional pain.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A clear pattern of avoidance emerged, with the author actively seeking to evade Albert and retreating to the woods as an escape mechanism. Compulsive behaviors included uncontrolled emotional outbursts and "extravagances," along with the physical manifestation of distress through lip-biting. There was a notable drive to seek out Charlotte only when she was isolated from Albert.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The most significant decision was the author's resolution to actively avoid Albert and strategically seek opportunities to be alone with Charlotte. While not explicitly an "action" by the author, Charlotte's confrontation about his "violent scenes" served as a critical external feedback loop regarding his behavior.

6. Emerging Themes
The central themes of the week revolved around intense unrequited love, the complexities of a love triangle, and the profound struggle with emotional self-regulation. Coping with a rival who surprisingly commands some respect also emerged. The reliance on avoidance behaviors as a coping mechanism for overwhelming emotional pain was a strong underlying pattern.
