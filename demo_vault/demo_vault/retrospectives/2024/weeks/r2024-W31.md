# r2024-W31

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The day centers on intense romantic rivalry—jealousy, scorn, and moments of delight around encounters with Charlotte and Albert. Missing other days limits pattern confidence: only one entry provided, so weekly trends are provisional.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: jealousy, scorn, infatuation, astonishment, delight; described as strong.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: black‑and‑white / self‑deprecating thinking and personalization *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: roaming/walking in woods, physical absence during Albert’s visits, seeking Charlotte alone.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes impetuosity and admires Albert’s temper; reflective prompts include steps to reduce impulsive reactions and when avoidance helps vs. hinders (from self‑questions).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent avoidance of situations with Albert, walking/rambling as an outlet, impulsive/extravagant reactions when encountering Charlotte, and minor self‑soothing (biting lips).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day snapshot: high emotional intensity that swings between agitation (jealousy/scorn) and brief delight when Charlotte is alone; no multi‑day trajectory available.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: rambles/walking in woods. Weight/sleep scores/other metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Repeated avoidance of Albert’s presence is an explicit coping pattern; seeking Charlotte alone occurs alongside avoidance and appears to govern social choices.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks recorded. Stated decisions: attempt to “escape from the yoke of such silly subterfuges” (intent declared) and continued avoidance during Albert’s visits (behavior observed).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Romantic rivalry fuels intense, impulsive emotional responses. 2) Avoidance/walking is the primary coping rhythm, reducing immediate distress but potentially complicating goals *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Intention to stop resigned passivity — declared, no clear evidence of action. Ongoing avoidance during visits — acted upon and documented. Seeking Charlotte alone — acted upon and reported.
