# r2024-W18

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Left an unpleasant situation and felt relief and unexpected happiness; found solace in a garden and anticipates stewardship. Major stressors: persistent rumination, guilt about Leonora, and family/financial negotiations regarding the mother’s portion.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: relief/joy at leaving, reflective soothedness in nature, punctuated by guilt and self‑accusation; intensity: Not specified.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: rumination; self‑blame; imagination amplifying past sorrow.  
• Coping Strategies: seeking solitude in nature; discussing matters with aunt and mother; promising deliberate present‑focus.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit commitment to stop ruminating and to forgive/ask forgiveness; consider concrete steps to reduce habitual rumination (prompt present in notes).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent: habitual rumination and deep reflection; turning to solitude/nature for emotional regulation; taking responsibility for family business. Notable one‑offs: formally leaving a situation, planning to assume stewardship of the garden, gardener’s recent attachment.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Recorded day shows a shift from guilt/self‑accusation toward relief and calm in nature; other days in the week are missing so overall trajectory is limited by incomplete data.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Weight/sleep scores/metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination episodes reported; tendency to ruminate may function as emotional avoidance of action or closure *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: left a situation; committed to stop ruminating; to inform and assist mother about her portion; expects to become master of the garden. Accomplishments: none recorded (✓0/0 tasks completed).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Persistent rumination and self‑accusation vs. nature/solitude as restorative balm. 2) Engagement with family obligations and an emerging transition of property/stewardship.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: stop ruminating; inform/assist mother; assume stewardship of the place. Follow‑through: intentions declared but no completed tasks recorded; family negotiations noted (aunt offered more than asked).
