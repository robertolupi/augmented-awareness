# r2024-W20

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week shows two coping poles: seeking solace (Homer, small pleasures) and active social kindness (helping at the fountain, joining dances). Major stressors are intense mood volatility, ongoing grief for a lost friend, and feeling misunderstood or compelled to conceal deeper qualities.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: rapid, high‑amplitude swings (sorrow ↔ immoderate joy; persistent melancholy and “burning fever” intensity on 2024‑05‑13).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: None specified.  
• Coping strategies: literary soothing (Homer), indulgence of emotional needs, simple communal pleasures (meals, excursions, dances), friendly practical help to others.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: reminders to tolerate misinterpretation, preserve humility, and consider when to express vs. conceal inner qualities (forward‑looking prompts drawn from reflections).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent reliance on literature for calming; habitual friendly engagement with common people and children; participation in local social activities; recurring concealment of talents; occasional self‑indulgence of emotional states.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Started the week with acute volatility and high inner heat, moved through outward sociability and helpfulness, and landed in lingering melancholy punctuated by brief uplift from communal activities.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Physical activity: 1.5 hours walking (explicit), helping carry a pitcher, participation in dances. Mental health: pronounced instability and grief; use of soothing routines.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Refusal of externally offered guidance/books and a direct request to friends not to raise the matter again; repeated concealment of abilities and inner life (limits authentic expression).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions taken: declined offered books/guidance, asked friend not to mention the issue, actively chose Homer for consolation, helped a servant‑girl, engaged in communal pleasures. No task completions recorded; planned visit to the district judge remains an intention.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Emotional volatility mitigated by literary solace and simple social contact; persistent tension between humility/kindness toward others and the cost of concealing inner qualities.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: do not mention the book matter (acted upon verbally), continue using Homer for calm (practiced), uphold friendly engagement with common people (practiced), visit the judge (intended; no completion noted).
