# r2024-W22

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week shows two clear sources of uplift: calming, restorative interactions with village children and vivid artistic inspiration from peasant life. Major stressors are persistent inner tumult, neglect of practical responsibilities due to artistic absorption, and indecision about whether to confront reality (seeing the mistress) or preserve an idealized image.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: ranges from “thoughts ... in tumult” to being “tranquillised” by children and “deeply moved,” heart “glows and burns.”  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
• Coping Strategies: artistic contemplation; lingering observation; spending time with and provisioning children; conversational listening.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: consider boundaries to balance art and duties; reflect on when preserving an image is kinder than direct knowledge; use child‑centered interaction as intentional calming practice.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent: frequent village visits, sharing coffee/milk/bread, giving small money gifts (kreutzers), sketching/lingering after gatherings, initiating conversations with peasants. Notable one‑offs: sitting on the plough for two hours; explicitly arranging bread purchase for a child.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood shifts from inner turmoil to calmness in the company of children and to passionate, elevated arousal when moved by acts of peasant fidelity.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: frequent visits, sketching, “sat on the plough for two hours.” Numeric metrics: “two hours.”

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Reports forgetting practical matters due to artistic absorption; regrets leaving the mother after she departed for town; hesitates to see the mistress to avoid disturbing an idealized image.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Acts taken: gave kreutzers and food, continued visits, shared evening meals with children. Deliberations: intends to try seeing the mistress but also contemplates refraining to preserve the beloved image. Logged completed tasks: none formalized.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Artistic immersion vs. practical engagement — creativity soothes but distracts. 2) Human, rural connection calms turmoil and fuels poetic feeling.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: continue visiting and provisioning children (acted upon); give kreutzers on Sundays (acted at least once); attempt to see the mistress (intended, not yet enacted). Gaps: no formal task completions recorded.
