# r2024-W29

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**
- The week alternates between life‑saving relief from the beloved’s music and intense romantic longing/physiological agitation; small social contacts (servant, morning sight) bring marked joy. Major stressors are acute inner conflict about desire, shame around expression, and intermittent near‑suicidal despair relieved only by her singing.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: ranges from near‑suicidal despair (r2024-07-16) to impatience and joyful anticipation (r2024-07-18–19) and assertive refusal (r2024-07-20).  
- Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑judgment/self‑labeling (“my heart is…corrupt/weak”); doubting authenticity of feelings (“Can that be a delusion…?”).  
- Coping Strategies: reliance on her piano/singing as immediate regulator; seeking mediated contact (sending servant); laughter/boundary‑setting.  
- Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: inviting self‑compassion around “weakness vs corruption” and experimenting with internal regulators beyond external music *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**
- Recurrent: intense physiological reactions to proximity, withdrawal/approach behavior, dependence on her music for crisis relief, morning ritual of looking at sun. One‑offs: sending a servant to connect; explicit refusal to accompany the ambassador.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**
- Mood moved from acute despair (briefly life‑threatening) that is rapidly alleviated by music, through impatient longing and joyful anticipation, toward calm assertiveness and refusal of unwanted subordination.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**
- Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.  
- Mental health trend: large emotional volatility with powerful external regulation via music; pattern interpretation limited by a missing entry (r2024-07-17), which reduces day‑to‑day continuity.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**
- Uses intermediaries (servant) instead of direct contact; suppresses public/physical affection due to shame. Reliance on proxy contact may prolong longing *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**
- Sent servant to Charlotte’s house (action taken). Declined proposal to accompany the ambassador (explicit refusal). Intention to see her on 2024-07-19 stated; outcome not recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**
- Music as immediate emotional regulator that prevents despair.  
- Intense romantic idealization producing physiological overwhelm, mediated contact, and shame that complicate direct expression.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**
- Sent servant to maintain connection — completed.  
- Decline to accompany ambassador — completed.  
- Intend to see her (7/19) — stated but no confirmation recorded. Continued autonomy over employment/roles — asserted; ongoing follow‑through partially documented.
