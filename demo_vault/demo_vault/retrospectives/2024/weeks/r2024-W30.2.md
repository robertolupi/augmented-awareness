# r2024-W30

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Deepened perceptual joy in nature and eagerness for more commissions contrast with a persistent creative block, self‑criticism about drawing, physical discomfort from correspondence, and an repeatedly failed pledge to avoid a person.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: mixed — intense happiness with nature (24), irritation/discomfort around letters (25), persistent temptation/conflict about visiting her (26).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: harsh self‑judgment / magnification of failure *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: consider switching to tactile media (clay/wax/dough), accept simpler sketches, request removal of writing‑sand, take responsibility for arranging work.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: try low‑pressure tactile exercises; experiment with modelling to translate perception into form.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: repeatedly restarting a portrait, pivoting to simpler media (sketch/profile) or tactile practice, proactively offering to arrange/accept commissions, habitual walks to Walheim that often lead to visiting her.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood swings from joyful and frustrated (24) to engaged but irritated (25) to conflicted and compelled (26); emotional intensity remains variable across days *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: walking to Walheim mentioned; physical reaction to writing‑sand noted. Numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance shows in admitted neglect of regular drawing and in repeated, unsuccessful pledges to stay away from the person—resolutions are made and then overridden by established triggers (walks, commissions).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: try modelling (clay/wax/dough), accept a sketched profile instead of forcing likeness, request no writing‑sand, offer to order/arrange and accept more commissions, pledge to stay away tomorrow. Completed tasks: none listed (0/0 across entries).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Heightened perception vs diminished execution: observation deepens but translation to line is blocked. 2) External obligations and embodied triggers repeatedly override intentions (commissions/walks/letters).

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: try tactile media (committed), accept simpler profile (acted), request removal of writing‑sand (stated), arrange/accept commissions (stated), stay away tomorrow (pledged but pattern shows promises are not maintained). Follow‑through is partial; creative and behavioral commitments are in progress or unmet.
