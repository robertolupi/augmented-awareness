# r2024-W31

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week (single entry) centers on intense jealousy and self‑awareness: admiration for Albert’s calmness and repeated violent scenes that terrify Charlotte are the main stressors. Solitude in the woods and explicit commitments to avoid further scenes are the key coping moves noted.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: jealousy, scorn (described as "infinite"), infatuation, agitation, embarrassment.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping Strategies: rambling/walking in woods, avoidance of Albert’s visits, seeking Charlotte when alone.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes (prompts): What would shift scorn/jealousy toward acceptance? How to change responses to avoid frightening Charlotte? When does solitude help versus enable avoidance?

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent: avoidance of being present during Albert’s visits; repeated walks in the woods; seeking private time with Charlotte. Notable one‑offs: “extravagant, violent” scenes and frequent lip‑biting.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Based on the single day, mood is highly agitated and jealous with low emotional regulation; absence of other days prevents a week‑long trajectory being established (missing days reduce confidence).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: regular rambles/walks. Weight/sleep scores/metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance is prominent: deliberately absent during Albert’s visits and using walks to withdraw from tense encounters; seeking Charlotte alone may both pursue attachment and avoid confrontation.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions/commitments noted: to depart as required, continue avoiding Albert/Charlotte meetings, use walks as coping, and refrain from scenes that terrify Charlotte. No completed tasks recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Intense jealousy and impulsive temper contrasted with admiration for another’s steadiness. 2) Solitude/avoidance as a primary coping strategy that soothes yet sustains interpersonal tension *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: depart when required; avoid being present during Albert's visits; walk in woods; stop scenes. Follow‑through: avoidance and walks are already used; success at stopping scenes is unclear/gap in evidence.
