# r2024-W25

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A week split between intense romantic absorption (late‑night wakefulness, a dawn of striking meaning) and a contrasting settled domestic contentment at Walheim. Major challenges: sleep disruption, temporal disorientation, and an overriding preoccupation that sidelines routine.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: swings from overpowering preoccupation and absorption (June 19) to calm, contented happiness in simple labor (June 21).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: all‑or‑nothing thinking *(inferred)* (e.g., "the whole world is nothing to me").  
• Coping Strategies: staying awake to be with Charlotte; daytime visit; gardening, cooking, reading Homer.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompt to restore routine after emotional events; reflect on how presence vs. rest affects wellbeing; identify small practices that reconnect to balance (echoed in entries).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent themes: nighttime wakefulness tied to relationship fixation; morning domestic rituals (rise at sunrise, gather and shell peas, cook, read Homer); regular walks/observation of landscape. One‑off: sleeping at "two in the morning" after the ball.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Energy/mood moved from heightened, sleep‑deprived emotional intensity to grounded, steady contentment driven by hands‑on domestic activity.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: went to bed "two in the morning" (June 19); rise at sunrise with active mornings (June 21). Activity: gardening, cooking, walking. Other metrics (weight, sleep scores): Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination episodes reported; however, intense fixation appears to displace routine and broader engagement *(inferred)* (e.g., staying awake and declaring the world nothing).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: stayed awake to watch/visit Charlotte; visited her the following day; chose to settle at Walheim and embrace domestic labor. Reported completed tasks: none specified.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Romantic/intense attachment can disrupt sleep and daily order. 2) Simple, nature‑rooted domestic routines reliably restore contentment and perspective.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: visit Charlotte (acted upon); continue sunrise routines, gardening, reading while valuing settled life (existing practice — ongoing). June 19 contained no formal action items.
