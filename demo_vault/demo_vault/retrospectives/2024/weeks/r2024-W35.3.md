# r2024-W35

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A small, cherished birthday gift and time in Charlotte’s orchard brought moments of keen joy and acceptance early in the week. By the next noted entry, longing for Charlotte escalated to obsessive anguish, physical collapse, and isolated sleeping outdoors — the major stressor is interpersonal obsession and its somatic fallout.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: ranged from nostalgic/joyful to desperate and anguished; intensity peaked in the latter entry.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: overgeneralization *(inferred, noted in source)*; catastrophic thinking; self‑deception (explicit).  
• Coping Strategies: cherishing keepsakes, walking/climbing in nature, physical withdrawal into solitude, sleeping outdoors for recovery.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit acceptance of life’s transience in the birthday entry; no self‑compassion strategy observed in the anguished entry.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent use of nature and physical activity as emotional regulation (orchard walks, tree‑climbing). Recurrent attachment behaviors to objects (kissing the ribbon). Repeated patterns of ruminative fixation on Charlotte and retreating into physical hardship.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood/energy moved from reflective warmth and active engagement with nature to escalating obsession, physiological distress, and low‑energy collapse.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: collapsed from exhaustion/thirst and “sleep till break of day” on the anguished day; daytime walks/climbing on the birthday day. Numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
When denied sympathy, the response is forced withdrawal into nature and solitude (wandering, cliffs, thickets) — an avoidant cycle that temporarily relieves but isolates.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decision to switch to a smaller Wetstein duodecimo Homer for walks (stated). Continued orchard activity occurred on the birthday entry. No task completions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Nature as a primary coping mechanism that provides brief relief; romantic obsession escalating into somatic collapse and isolation.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
• Use smaller Homer for walks — stated; follow‑through not confirmed in later notes *(inferred lack of data)*.  
• Continue spending time in Charlotte’s orchard — practiced on the birthday entry.  
• No new recovery commitments recorded on the anguished day.
