# r2024-W27

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Charlotte’s caregiving and simple domestic scenes (walks, spring, child‑care) produced moments of reverence and comfort; the major stressor was repeated exposure to ill‑humour and sorrow that provoked strong emotional reactions. Only two dated entries (2024‑07‑01 and 2024‑07‑06) are present—missing days limit pattern resolution.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: deep sadness/grief and moral disturbance (7/1); affectionate reverence and calm appreciation (7/6).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: a negative generalization (“happy days few, evil days many”) noted *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: Charlotte uses activity/music/garden to shift mood; narrator withdraws briefly to compose himself, tells stories, seeks closeness with Charlotte and children.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: narrator vows to “spare” himself for Charlotte’s sake; the group frames activity as a remedy.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent: visiting, walking, attentive caregiving, using simple rituals (spring water, music) to restore temper. Notable one‑offs: narrator’s weeping and leaving a conversation, kissing the child, defending “innocent delusions” in discussion.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moved from acute distress and moral agitation (early in the week entry) toward gentler affection and reverent calm by the later entry.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep metrics: Not specified. Physical activity: walking, gardening, caring for others, and washing at the spring are reported. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
The narrator physically withdraws from distressing scenes (leaving the room, burying his face) and no tasks are recorded as completed on the documented days (✓0/0), suggesting moments of disengagement.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Charlotte departs to care for a dying woman (action taken); the vicar plans a summer at Carlsbad (stated); narrator resolves to moderate his eagerness/self‑exposure (intention stated). No other task completions noted.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Caregiving and compassion consistently anchor the week, while emotional sensitivity and ill‑humour create relational strain; activity/music emerge as a recurring, practical antidote.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Charlotte: go to town to tend the dying woman — appears acted upon.  
- Vicar: spend summer at Carlsbad — stated.  
- Narrator: “spare” himself for Charlotte’s sake — intention recorded, no clear evidence of sustained follow‑through in entries.
