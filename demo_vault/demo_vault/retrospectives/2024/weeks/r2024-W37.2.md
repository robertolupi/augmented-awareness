# r2024-W37

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week (single entry) centers on a charged farewell: a moonlit reunion, intense grief, and a resolved departure at sunrise. Major stressors are acute anguish, the prospect of permanent separation, and the foreboding attached to a specific place.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: intense anguish, agitation, restlessness, melancholy, grief (described physically: gasping, trembling, weeping).  
• Cognitive distortions: None specified.  
• Coping strategies: seeking solitude in a beloved spot, holding Charlotte's hand, crying, verbal assurances of reunion, emotional restraint during the interview.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: acknowledge courage in concealing intention; reflect on coping after departure and the role of the avenue in emotional responses.  
(Note: only one day provided — limited trend inference.)

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors that day: repeated visits to the terrace/avenue, pacing when agitated, clasping/kissing hands, crying, running after the departing figure, watching sunset/moonrise.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Across the entry mood stays acutely low with moments of resolute control—grief peaks during farewell, brief composure during the interview.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: nocturnal/early‑morning vigilance, walking the terrace, pacing. Numeric metrics: durations mentioned in context but not sleep scores ("two hours' duration", "half an hour", "six months old").

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination; deliberate decision to depart and to withhold intention during the interview (action taken as described).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: depart at sunrise; maintain secrecy in the interview; leave after farewell. Accomplishments: exercised self‑control by not revealing intention; executed the departure (followed briefly, then she vanished). Completed task list: none observed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) grief, memory, and imagined reunion anchored to a specific landscape; 2) emotional restraint and decisive departure shaping the week’s narrative.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: depart at sunrise (planned; departure enacted), horses at the door (planned — outcome not specified), not betray intention (acted upon). Gaps: limited data for other days reduces confidence in patterns.
