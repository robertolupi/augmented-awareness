1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was overwhelmingly defined by a singular, profound encounter: meeting Charlotte. This event ignited an immediate and intense infatuation, leading to moments of immense joy, particularly during a country ball where deep emotional and intellectual connections were forged. The primary stressor emerged from the sudden and re-confirmed awareness of Charlotte's engagement to another man, Albert, which briefly disrupted the author's emotional equilibrium.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The author's mood experienced a dramatic trajectory, moving from an initial state of contentedness to an overwhelming and rapturous infatuation. Energy levels appear exceptionally high, fueled by the intense emotions, described as feeling "more than mortal" while dancing. This emotional peak was punctuated by a brief moment of shock and confusion upon the revelation of the engagement, before culminating in an almost physically overwhelming state of awe and tenderness.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Physically, the author reports no issues, rather a sensation of lightness and heightened vitality. Mentally, the week was characterized by extreme emotional intensity, bordering on obsession. The mind was entirely consumed by Charlotte, leading to a temporary suspension of previously known facts (her engagement) and a profound inability to objectively perceive or describe the object of his affection.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
A clear pattern of impulsivity driven by infatuation emerged, evidenced by the immediate desire to ride to Charlotte despite prior vows. Idealization of Charlotte was pronounced, with the author admitting his inability to objectively describe her. There was also a notable loss of emotional composure when confronted with the reality of her engagement, indicating a difficulty processing emotionally challenging information in this intensely infatuated state.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The decision to attend the country ball proved pivotal, leading to the defining encounter of the week. Engaging in extensive dancing and profound conversations with Charlotte were meaningful actions that deepened the emotional connection. The author's emotional surrender to the overwhelming feelings, particularly during the "Klopstock" moment, represented a significant internal event.

6. Emerging Themes
The dominant themes emerging are intense infatuation and love at first sight, coupled with the profound emotional intensity these feelings evoke. Idealization of the beloved is a strong undercurrent. The pre-existing engagement serves as an immediate, challenging obstacle to this burgeoning connection, setting up a potential conflict for future entries.
