# r2024-W24

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**
- A vivid evening of dancing and intense infatuation around Charlotte (minuet, country dances, waltz) provided exhilaration and intimacy; the thunderstorm and the revelation that Charlotte is engaged to Albert produced confusion, awkwardness, and tears.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**
- Mood spectrum & intensity: intense infatuation → exhilaration → agitation → tearful overwhelm (high emotional arousal).
- Primary cognitive distortions: None observed.
- Coping strategies: using play (counting game), social ritual (dancing), and Charlotte’s affected courage to steady others.
- Growth & self‑compassion prompts: reflect on what about Charlotte shapes the attachment; consider how to moderate impulsivity when overwhelmed; reconcile vow about waltzing with her engagement (questions recorded in journal).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**
- Recurrent behaviours in this entry: writing to Wilhelm as habitual correspondence; dancing and making vows in emotional moments; impulsive urge to ride out and repeated checking of the sun; using games to manage fear.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**
- Across the entry mood rose to exhilaration during dances, dipped into confusion upon learning of the engagement, and closed in tearful emotional release.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**
- Sleep, weight, numeric health metrics: Not specified.  
- Note: only one day provided; absence of other days limits trend detection *(inferred)*.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**
- Avoidance of writing: tempted to ride out instead of writing to Wilhelm and described being “three times on the point of throwing down my pen.”

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**
- Decisions/actions recorded: vowed exclusivity in waltzing (personal vow), agreed to propose partner exchange to waltz with Charlotte (action taken), committed to give Wilhelm a detailed account (intention). No routine tasks marked complete (0/0 tasks completed).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**
- Romantic idealization focused through dance and literary sensibility; social rituals and playful games serve as immediate emotion‑regulation tools.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**
- Intends to write a full account to Wilhelm — stated, not shown completed.  
- Vowed exclusivity in waltzing — enacted in the moment.  
- Proposed partner exchange to secure a waltz — acted upon. Gaps: no evidence of completed follow‑up writing.
