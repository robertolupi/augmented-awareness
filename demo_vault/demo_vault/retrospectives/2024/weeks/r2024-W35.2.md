# r2024-W35

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two contrasting poles: tender, nostalgic joy from small gifts and time outdoors (orchard, books, ribbon) versus an escalating, consuming romantic despair that drives physical flight and collapse. Major stressor: overwhelming obsession leading to exhaustion and self‑harmful coping.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: ranged from "keenest joy" and acceptance to intense obsession, melancholy, and hopelessness.  
• Primary cognitive distortions: overgeneralization *(inferred)*; catastrophizing and all‑or‑nothing/selective attention *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: tactile/ritual actions (kissing ribbon), nostalgia, outdoor activity (climbing trees, wandering), vigorous physical exertion, self‑inflicted hardship, tears seeking sympathy.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: explicit acceptance present on 2024‑08‑28; 2024‑08‑30 shows recognition of self‑deception but no self‑compassion strategies.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent outdoor behaviors: climbing trees, harvesting pears, long walks/cliffs, sleeping outdoors to recover; ritualizing small objects (kissing ribbon); recurrent rumination about “her”; no task completion reported.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Starts with wistful pleasure and calm activity, then shifts rapidly to escalating emotional intensity, physical exhaustion, and collapse.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: sleeping outdoors after collapse reported; numeric sleep metrics: Not specified. Activity/injuries: repeated vigorous outdoor exertion and lacerations from thorns on 2024‑08‑30. Weight/sleep score: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Tasks completed: none reported (✓0/0 tasks completed). Emotional avoidance through physical flight (wandering, climbing, forcing through thickets) and withdrawal from obligations.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No task completions or formal accomplishments recorded; meaningful reception and cherishing of gifts (ribbon, books) and acceptance of life's transience noted as an internal resolution.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Nature and small, tangible gestures provide solace, while an obsessive attachment repeatedly undermines wellbeing and produces self‑harmful escape behaviors.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: none specified/observed. Notable gap: reflective questions present but no actionable commitments or follow‑through documented.

10. **Summary Tags**
