# r2024-W29

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Intense longing and moments of joy (direct or proxy) recur, while music repeatedly disperses acute despair — once even halting suicidal gloom. Major stressors: overpowering romantic fixation, shame about expression, and recurring self‑judgment.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: swings between ecstatic anticipation/joy and profound despair; moments of relief are vivid and rapid.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑judgment (heart “weak” vs “corrupt”); labeling others as “a fool.”  
• Coping Strategies: music as immediate regulator, seeking proxy contact (servant), single‑minded focus on hoped‑for meetings, humor/boundary setting.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: there are explicit openings to accept feelings and reframe shame — opportunity to practice self‑compassion is present *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: strong physical sensitivity to accidental touch and proximity; turning to music for emotional relief; using a surrogate (servant) to obtain contact; morning ritual of looking at the sun and letting one hopeful thought dominate; firm boundary‑setting regarding proposed subordination.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Overall the week oscillates: mornings and proxy contacts bring high energy and joy, intimacy triggers both agitation and craving, and music punctuates low moments with rapid calming.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, exercise, weight and numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Withdrawing then approaching in intimate moments; withholding direct contact with Charlotte and instead sending a servant (proxy contact); repeated notes of “no tasks completed” on multiple days — pattern of unreported task completion rather than documented progress.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Sent a servant to Charlotte’s house (action); explicitly declined accompanying the ambassador (boundary decision); stated intention to see her on one morning (commitment recorded, outcome not reported).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Music and symbolic/proxy contact reliably soothe intense affect; simultaneous themes of consuming longing and moral/self‑judgment about those desires.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Sent servant to Charlotte — acted.  
- Declined ambassador accompaniment — acted.  
- “See her today” (stated) — follow‑through not specified.  
- Daily task completion: repeatedly none observed.
