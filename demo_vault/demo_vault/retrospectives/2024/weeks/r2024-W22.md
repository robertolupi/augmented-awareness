# r2024-W22

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week shows two clear sources of solace: frequent, grounding contact with a village family and a moved response to a peasant’s story of devotion; major challenges are an underlying inner tumult, artistic absorption that neglects practical details, and the tension about whether to see a woman whose image the narrator idealizes. Most days of the week are missing from the journal, limiting pattern certainty.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: disturbed/tumultuous → tranquillized by the children; separately pleased/enkindled and deeply moved by the peasant’s devotion.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None observed.  
• Coping Strategies: repeated visits, small acts of provision (money, sugar, food), lingering behind social groups to avoid disagreeable company, preserving an idealized image by contemplating not seeing the woman *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes calming power of simple domestic life; reluctant to “spoil” a sweet image—prompt: consider when direct contact aids growth versus when preservation protects well‑being.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: frequent visits to the same family, giving food/money and small gifts (sugar, kreutzers on Sundays), long periods of artistic contemplation (sitting two hours on the plough), and habitually engaging familiarly with peasants.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
One sentence: energy/mood shift from inner tumult to calming steadiness in the company of the children, with intermittent spikes of warmth and inspiration when moved by others’ devotion.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified.  
Activity: “two hours” sitting on the plough (May 27).  
Other metrics (weight, sleep score): Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance of disagreeable company by lingering behind; deliberation about whether to meet the widow (intent to delay to preserve an ideal) and artistic absorption that sometimes causes neglect of practical details.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions/actions completed: gave money and small gifts, shared food in evenings, continued frequent visits and provisioning; social acquaintance formed with a peasant and observation of a plough being arranged. Intentions expressed to seek out the widow.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Simple, repeated domestic contact calms artistic unrest. 2) Tension between preserving an idealized image and pursuing direct knowledge (art_vs_reality).

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Continue frequent visits: followed through (reports of repeated visits).  
- Give sugar/milk/bread and kreutzers on Sundays: acted (gifts, provisions reported).  
- Give small sums for wheaten bread/broth when needed: acted (money given).  
- Attempt to see the widow “as soon as I can”: intention stated, not yet reported completed. Note: missing days limit assessment.
