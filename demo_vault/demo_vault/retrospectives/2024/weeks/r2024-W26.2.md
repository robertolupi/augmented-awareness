1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week’s highlight is sustained, affectionate engagement with children (play, tickling, rebuilding card houses). The main stressor is external judgment from the town physician and broader adult social expectations; the narrator consciously decides to stop ruminating on the matter.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: deeply moved, affectionate toward children (strong).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
• Coping Strategies: active play with children; allowing criticism to pass without internalizing it.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes overthinking and states “I will not further bewilder myself with this subject”; prompt: how to balance play and social expectations?

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent habits: Not specified beyond this entry. Notable behaviors: physically engaging play (catching, tickling, rebuilding card houses), tolerant posture toward criticism, prioritizing relational play over concern for dignity.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, weight, numeric metrics: Not specified. Physical activity: playful, energetic interaction with children documented.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Chose to continue playing with children despite disapproval; explicitly decided not to further bewilder himself about the topic; maintained composure during social criticism.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Children as moral exemplars and primary emotional focus. 2) Prioritizing present, child‑centered engagement over adult conventions and concern for reputation.
