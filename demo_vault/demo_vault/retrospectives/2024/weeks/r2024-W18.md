# r2024-W18

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The entry records relief at leaving a close friend, renewed resolve to stop ruminating, comfort found in solitude and the estate/garden, and commitments to attend family business; main stressors are guilt about Leonora and habitual rumination. Only one day’s entry is provided, limiting week‑wide pattern confidence.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: relief/happiness about leaving, remorse/guilt about Leonora, determination to improve, contentment in solitude.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: persistent rumination and excessive imaginative dwelling on past sorrow.  
• Coping Strategies: retreat to nature/solitude, practical engagement (mother’s business), deliberate resolution to enjoy the present.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes (forward‑looking prompts drawn from entry): What concrete steps will stop rumination? How will you inform and follow through on your mother’s business? How will you steward the garden and honor the late Count?

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent pattern of turning to solitude and nature for emotional regulation; frequent retrospective rumination; practical steps toward family responsibilities and estate stewardship; social withdrawal from a close relationship (decision to leave company).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood shifts from relief about separation to guilt, then settles into present‑focused contentment and resolve while energy appears steady in practical planning (based on actions described).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric health metrics: Not specified. Mental trend: recurring rumination vs. soothing effect of nature.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance or procrastination episodes reported; persistent rumination is noted and could serve as avoidance of present engagement *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: left the company of a close friend; committed to inform/attend mother’s business; will assume stewardship of the estate/garden. Accomplishments: visited aunt and secured goodwill; no checkbox tasks completed (explicitly 0/0).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: rumination vs. intentional present‑living (tension between past fixation and decision to improve); nature/solitude as a reliable regulator that supports practical follow‑through.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: stop rumination (commitment), inform/attend to mother’s business, assume stewardship of the garden/estate. Evidence of follow‑through: planning and visits noted (aunt, estate), but no completed task checkboxes; final execution of commitments not documented.
