# r2024-W31

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on intense jealousy and unrequited attachment to Charlotte, contrasted with relief when avoiding encounters; major stressors are emotional scenes and fear of harming Charlotte. Acknowledgment of Albert’s steadiness is a recurring stabilizing observation.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: jealousy, scorn, infatuation, resentment, distress — described as strong.  
• Primary cognitive distortions: None specified.  
• Coping strategies: deliberate avoidance of visits; walking/rambling in woods.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: no explicit self‑compassion practices; potential to practice acceptance of Charlotte’s engagement *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent avoidance of shared spaces during Albert’s visits, repeated rambles in the woods, and occasional intense emotional displays ("extravagances"); no task completion recorded.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood stays at a high level of emotional intensity (jealousy/distress) with brief relief when physically removing oneself from triggers.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: walking/rambles reported. Sleep scores/weight/other metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance is a clear pattern: leaving or staying away during visits to prevent scenes. There is also avoidance of directly reconciling feelings with Charlotte’s engagement *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: to depart as required (stated), to stay away during Albert’s visits, and to use walking as coping. Accomplishments: no tasks completed were recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Jealousy/avoidance cycle that temporarily reduces confrontation but sustains distress; a contrast between the narrator’s impetuosity and Albert’s calm steadiness that underpins relational tension.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: depart (stated; action not confirmed), continue staying away during visits (acted upon — "I am always away now"), use walking/rambles as coping (acted upon). Gaps: no task completion or explicit emotional-resolution steps documented.
