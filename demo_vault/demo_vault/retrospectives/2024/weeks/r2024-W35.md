# r2024-W35

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Birthday warmth and quiet gratitude for small, attentive gifts (kissing a ribbon; orchard play) contrast with episodes of overwhelming romantic obsession and despair that drive the author into solitary, physically punishing escapes. Entries are from Aug 28 and Aug 30 only; intervening days are missing, limiting pattern resolution.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: ranges from keen joy and acceptance to intense melancholy and despair.  
• Primary cognitive distortions: obsessive fixation on a beloved (explicit); catastrophizing that “death” is the only end *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: savoring small tokens, immersive nature escapes, strenuous physical exertion, self‑punishing exposure to thorns, seeking sympathy from Charlotte.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: reflections prompt noticing small attentions and asking what non‑harmful supports could replace punitive escapes (questions present in entries).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: savoring sentimental objects and orchard play (kissing ribbon, climbing trees). Recurrent reaction to emotional overwhelm: leave social situation and undertake solitary, exhausting walks/climbs, often causing lacerations or sleeping outdoors until dawn.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Joyful, reflective energy around the birthday shifts rapidly to agitated, high‑arousal despair with episodes of physical exhaustion following emotional overwhelm.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: occasional outdoor sleep until dawn. Activity: intense solitary exertion, climbing, wandering; injuries noted (lacerations). Numeric sleep/activity metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance: when sympathy is withheld, the author habitually withdraws from Charlotte and into nature (explicit). Classic procrastination of tasks: Not specified.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No listed task completions. Repeatedly enacted choice to remove oneself when distressed (explicit). Embraced small, readable gifts (books) and simple social attentions as meaningful.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Two threads: tender appreciation of small, sustaining attentions versus an all‑consuming romantic longing that catalyzes harmful, escapist physical behaviors.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Continue enjoying orchard time — evidenced by climbing and shared pears (acted).  
- Withdraw to solitary exertion when denied sympathy — repeatedly acted.  
- Intend to treasure small attentions rather than seek grand gifts *(inferred: stated as value, action partial)*.
