1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Consolation from Count C— and permission to visit Miss B— were the week's bright spots; the dominant stressor was a recurring, pedantic conflict with an ambassador that provoked sustained annoyance and withdrawal.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: annoyance, indignation, contempt, weariness (reported strongly).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: judging others by oneself (identified by the author).  
• Coping Strategies: defending a friend, withdrawing to avoid escalation, distant observation.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes agitation and unfair judgments; expresses desire for small happiness and restraint.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: principled defense of acquaintances, withdrawing when anger rises, close social observation, preference for finishing business and moving on. One‑off: arranging a visit to Miss B— after receiving permission.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood stayed irritable and contemptuous around the ambassador incident; energy and day‑to‑day variation not specified, limiting trajectory assessment.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, physical activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Active avoidance: left confrontations deliberately to prevent escalation. Productivity note: "✓0/0 tasks completed" indicates no recorded task completions that day.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions taken: defended Count C— verbally and withdrew to keep peace; secured permission to visit Miss B—. Accomplishments: social arrangements made; no other tasks completed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Defending close ties triggers principled agitation against petty authority. 2) Social rank and pretension provoke withdrawal and a yearning for simpler, steady work.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Committed: visit Miss B— (permission obtained; follow‑through pending). Committed: avoid escalating confrontations (acted upon by withdrawing). Committed: curb judging others (acknowledged intention; implementation ongoing) *(inferred)*.
