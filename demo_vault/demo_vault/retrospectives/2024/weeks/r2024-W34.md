1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week began with profound emotional distress stemming from a deep sense of loss and longing for an absent loved one, leading to intense grief and disrupted sleep. This quickly transitioned into a pervasive state of apathy, restlessness, and indecision, marked by an inability to focus or engage meaningfully. A significant stressor is an internal conflict between a desire for purpose and structure (like a job opportunity) and a deep-seated fear of losing freedom or self, metaphorically described by the fable of the horse.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
Mood started with intense sorrow, grief, and melancholy, followed by a shift towards discontent, apathy, and restless indecision. Melancholy remained a consistent underlying mood. Energy levels are consistently low; beginning with "weary slumbers" due to emotional pain, and progressing to a state where "active spirits have degenerated into contented indolence," indicating a significant loss of motivation and productive drive.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health is severely impacted, characterized by intense grief, despair, loneliness, apathy, and existential dread. There's a clear indication of burnout, with an inability to think or engage. Physically, sleep is non-restorative, and emotional distress manifests in physical symptoms such as tears. The overall trend indicates a deteriorating mental state strongly affecting physical well-being and daily function.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
Compulsive behaviors include physically seeking the absent loved one in bed and uncontrollable weeping. Avoidant patterns are prominent, particularly on the second day, with a descent into "contented indolence" and indecision preventing action. There's an internal avoidance of commitment to structure, driven by a fear of losing personal freedom or identity.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The only notable action is the contemplation of seeking a job appointment at the embassy and having been "on the point of writing" to a minister. This suggests a nascent attempt to find purpose or structure, though it is immediately undermined by internal anxieties and indecision.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
Recurring themes include profound loss and intense longing, a persistent struggle with restlessness and apathy, and a significant internal conflict between the desire for purpose and structure versus the fear of losing personal freedom. There's an overarching sense of existential dread and being "totally lost."
