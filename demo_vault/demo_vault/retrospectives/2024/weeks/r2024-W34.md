# r2024-W34

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
This week centers on two linked struggles: acute yearning and grief that intrude on sleep and mornings, and a paralysing restlessness/indecision that blocks work. Small positives: dreams provide temporary comfort and the idea of an embassy appointment is actively considered.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense longing and sorrow (day 21); melancholic, indolent, anxious restlessness and loss of enjoyment (day 22).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing *(inferred from "weep over my future woes")*; all‑or‑nothing thinking (explicit: "Once we give ourselves up, we are totally lost.").  
• Coping Strategies: seeking solace in dreams, crying, imagining alternative roles, recalling a fable as decision framework, contemplating writing to a minister.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: short prompts — acknowledge small comforts (dreams), consider one concrete, low‑effort step toward the embassy inquiry.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent: repeated waking/searching in bed and reliance on dreams; rumination and imagining alternate identities; little to no task completion across entries.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Starts with sleep‑disrupted sorrow and longing, then shifts into daytime melancholic inertia and restless indecision that suppresses initiative.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: "weary slumbers," half‑sleep confusion, vivid dreams (explicit). Numeric metrics: Not specified. Note: 5 of 7 days' entries are missing, limiting trend clarity and confidence in trajectories.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Repeated inability to begin work despite urge not to be idle ("I cannot be idle, and yet I am unable to set to work."), plus rumination about changing roles rather than taking a concrete step.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Consideration of writing to Wilhelm/the minister about an embassy appointment (active decision point). No recorded completed tasks (✓0/0).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Grief/yearning permeates sleep and morning affect. 2) Restlessness and envy of simpler purposeful work fuel indecision and inaction.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: contemplate/writing to minister about embassy post (day 22). Follow‑through: not completed in provided entries. Several days missing, so follow‑through status may be incomplete.
