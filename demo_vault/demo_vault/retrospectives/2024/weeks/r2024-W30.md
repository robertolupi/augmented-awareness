# r2024-W30

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A strong, recurring love of nature and eagerness for commissions contrast with a frustrating creative block: vivid perception but weakened execution in drawing. Sensory irritations (writing‑sand) and repeated failure to keep a boundary (resolving not to visit someone) are notable stressors.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: explicitly “happier” and content with nature (24); eagerness mixed with irritation (25); conflicted/tempted about visits (26).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: none specified; presence of rationalizations around visits *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: try different media (modelling, clay, wax, dough), simplify subject (profile sketch), request changes to correspondence, make firm resolutions.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompts to try modelling and accept simpler outcomes are present; consider framing experiments as learning rather than failure.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Repeatedly restarting portraits (three attempts), shifting mediums when execution falters, offering to manage/arrange commissions, sensitivity to materials in letters, and taking walks that often lead to visits.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood swings from joyful and perceptive to frustrated and conflicted across entries, with energy directed toward both creative attempts and social/errand‑driven outings.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: walking to Walheim and extending walks to visit her; physical reactions to correspondence (teeth set on edge) noted. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Admits neglecting drawing (“how little I have lately done”); repeatedly fails to honor a resolution to avoid visiting her—visits recur despite intentions.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: try modelling if the block continues; order and arrange everything for commissions; request no more writing‑sand; resolve not to see her. Accomplishments: no completed tasks recorded in entries.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) vivid inner perception vs. impaired outward execution in creative work; 2) boundary tension—clear intentions to avoid contact repeatedly undermined by habitual walks/visits.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Plans stated: try modelling (planned; no evidence of completion), order/arrange commissions (intention stated; follow‑through not shown), ask correspondents to stop using writing‑sand (request stated), resolve not to visit her (explicitly repeatedly broken).
