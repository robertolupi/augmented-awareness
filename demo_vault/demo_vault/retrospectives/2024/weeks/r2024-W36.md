# r2024-W36

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Decision to depart is the central positive — firm resolve credited to Wilhelm — while the major stressor is prolonged deliberation about leaving a woman who has just returned to town, creating immediacy.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: moved from wavering to determined on the recorded day; intensity not specified.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping Strategies: sought or acknowledged external counsel (thanking Wilhelm).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: forward‑looking prompts present (What immediate steps? How did Wilhelm change thinking? What outcomes are anticipated?) — these questions are explicit and useful for next steps.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent pattern of extended deliberation (a fortnight of thought) about a relationship decision; explicit acknowledgment of external input (Wilhelm). No daily routines, work rhythms, or task completions recorded.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
On the recorded day mood shifted from wavering to firm resolve; absence of other days limits observing a multi‑day trajectory.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination on tasks; prolonged rumination about leaving suggests delay/avoidance in decisive action over the prior fortnight *(inferred)*. No task completions recorded.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Primary decision: intention to depart ("I must away"/"I must go"). No completed action items logged. Decision is linked to Albert and catalyzed by Wilhelm's input.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
A thread of extended internal debate (rumination) that is resolved by outside perspective, producing a clear intent to depart.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Commitment to depart is stated; follow‑through not documented. Connection to Albert noted as part of the commitment; actual actions to enact the decision are not specified.
