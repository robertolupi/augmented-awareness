1.  **Weekly Highlights & Stressors**
    The central event of the week, as captured so far, is a definitive and significant personal decision to end a relationship after a prolonged two-week period of "wavering purpose." This period of indecision served as a major stressor, while the eventual resolution represents the key highlight.

2.  **Changes in Mood or Energy**
    The week indicates a significant shift from a state of prolonged internal conflict and indecision to one of resolution, determination, and clarity. There is a newfound sense of urgency and finality following the decision.

3.  **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**
    Mentally, a period of sustained stress and uncertainty related to a personal dilemma has concluded, leading to a marked improvement in mental clarity and a reduction in internal conflict. Physical health information is not available for this period.

4.  **Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns**
    A pattern of prolonged indecision, described as "wavering purpose" for two weeks, suggests an avoidance of making a difficult personal choice. This pattern was broken by the decisive action taken.

5.  **Meaningful Actions or Decisions**
    The most meaningful action was the definitive decision to leave "her." This was a pivotal moment influenced by external factors and seeking counsel.
