# r2024-W36

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The main positive is a clear, decisive shift — the author resolves to leave and expresses gratitude to Wilhelm for clarifying purpose. The major stressor is prolonged wavering about a relationship (a fortnight of rumination) and the need to act regarding Albert.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: moves from sustained indecision to firm determination/resolution (single‑day snapshot).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
• Coping Strategies: expressing gratitude to Wilhelm; choosing to take decisive action.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: no explicit self‑compassion practices; reflective prompts included: "What did Wilhelm say or do that clarified your wavering purpose?" *(inferred)* and "What steps will you take next when you 'must away'?" *(inferred)*

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
No ongoing daily routines specified. Notable one‑offs: a fortnight of rumination, thanking Wilhelm for decisive input, and an immediate stated intent to depart and to go to Albert.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Within this entry mood/energy shift is from prolonged wavering to resolute action; broader weekly trajectory is unclear due to missing days.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
A prolonged fortnight of rumination indicates avoidance/decisional delay; the entry records a transition out of that pattern but offers no evidence of sustained behavioral change.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: to leave ("I must away.") and to go to Albert. Accomplishments: none recorded (✓0/0 tasks completed).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) prolonged rumination versus sudden decisive action; 2) reliance on external input (Wilhelm) to resolve internal indecision.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: depart and visit/address Albert. Follow‑through: not recorded/completed in this entry.
