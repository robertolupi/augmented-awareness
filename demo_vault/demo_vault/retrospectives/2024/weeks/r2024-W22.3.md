# r2024-W22

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Simple, caretaking interactions with village children and small acts of charity grounded the week; major stressors were an internally "disturbed" mind (5/27) and a restless, romantic agitation over an idealized widow (5/30).

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: 5/27 — absorbed, tumultuous, then tranquillised by children; 5/30 — deeply impressed, "glows and burns" (strong positive arousal).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: idealization (explicit on 5/30); none noted on 5/27.  
• Coping Strategies: spending quiet time observing children, sharing food/money, lingering away from unwanted company.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: notice how simple routines calm turmoil; prompt: allow the calming routines to be scheduled intentionally.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: frequent visits to the children, sharing sugar/milk/bread/butter, giving kreutzers (weekly on Sundays via the mother), long periods sitting/observing (e.g., "two hours" on the plough), lingering behind social company and engaging peasants to hear stories.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moved from inner disturbance on 5/27 that was soothed by caretaking contact to an emotionally enkindled, romanticized state by 5/30.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: episodes of extended sitting/observation ("two hours"). Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance appears as lingering behind to escape disliked company and a deliberate choice to preserve an idealized image by not confronting reality (prefers to see the widow "through the eyes of her lover").

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: gave kreutzers to the children, resolved to continue visiting and sharing food; weighed whether to seek out the widow (intended but ambivalent). Accomplishments: charitable acts and deepened rapport with villagers; recorded "✓0/0 tasks completed" in both notes.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Simple, caretaking routines reliably soothe inner turmoil. 2) A strong tendency to romanticize others leads to protective avoidance of direct contact.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: continue visiting children and giving kreutzers (evidence of ongoing visits — acted upon); provide money for wheaten bread next outing (intended); try to see the widow "as soon as I can" but may refrain to preserve the image (unresolved).
