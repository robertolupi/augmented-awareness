# r2024-W28

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Moments of intense romantic longing and brief exaltation (belief that Charlotte may love him) sit alongside recurring embarrassment, self‑reproach and jealousy; compassion for an ill acquaintance and the dying wife's confession are quieter, stabilizing scenes.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: longing, tearful sadness, embarrassment in company, occasional exaltation and doubt.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑labeling ("what a child I am"), mind‑reading/assumption about Charlotte, all‑or‑nothing thinking *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: close observation, prayer, asking for forgiveness, self‑questioning.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: practice gentler self‑language; seek small actions to soothe when feeling overlooked *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent attentive observation of Charlotte and social scenes, standing motionless rather than intervening, occasional walking/outings, regular visits/prayer for the ill; no task completion reported.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood swings between longing/despair and brief elation; episodes of shame/withdrawal punctuate the week, with at least one report of sleepiness. *(inferred)*

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: "weighed down with sleep" reported once (2024‑07‑08). Activity: walking on outing (2024‑07‑08). Other metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Repeated passive observation and silence in social/romantic moments (standing motionless, feeling foolish rather than acting) suggests avoidance of direct expression of feelings *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No formal tasks completed across entries (✓0/0 noted). Actions: visited and prayed for Madame M—; observed and reflected deeply about Charlotte; no declared behavioral commitments carried out.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Intense romantic fixation that alternates between self‑honour and self‑deprecation. 2) Sensitivity to social appearance and a tendency to interpret others (love, household finances) at face value or by comforting uncertainty.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated/observed intentions: continue praying for Madame M— (ongoing). Other intended actions: none specified; repeated lack of task completion noted.
