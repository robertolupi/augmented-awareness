1. **Key Events**
   - Admission into a family and strong affectionate bonds with its members (to be loved by the father as a son).  
   - Close relationship with Charlotte and emotional turmoil about that connection (often moves me to tears).  
   - Pleasant rambles and conversations about Charlotte with others (you would be delighted to hear us).  
   - Recounting Charlotte's mother’s devoted care and its effect on Charlotte (every moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love).  
   - Walk where the author plucks flowers, arranges a nosegay, then throws them into a stream and watches them float away (pluck flowers... then fling them into the first stream).  
   - News that Albert will remain, has received a government appointment with a good salary, and is punctual and methodical in business (Albert is to remain here; government appointment).
