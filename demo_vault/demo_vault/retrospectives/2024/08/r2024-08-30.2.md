4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   - Obsession with "her" as central focus ("I cannot pray except to her"; "all surrounding objects are of no account").

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The author recognizes self‑deception and compulsive drives: "Why do I thus deceive myself?" and notes the heart's compulsion ("to what does not my heart often compel me!").

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What small, safe alternatives to physical escape might provide relief when sympathy is absent?
   - How might I acknowledge this self‑deception compassionately without increasing the sense of hopelessness?
   - When have I experienced any relief without resorting to extreme solitude or exertion?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - If Charlotte does not reciprocate sympathy, the author will tear himself away and seek relief by wandering, climbing, or forcing a path through thickets (described recurring behavior).
