# r2024-08-30

1. **Key Events**
   - Intense, consuming love/obsession with “her,” to the exclusion of all else (illustrative quote: "I cannot pray except to her.").
   - Physical and sensory overwhelm during/after time with her: dimmed sight, confused hearing, oppressed breathing, urgent heart (illustrative quote: "my sight grows dim, my hearing confused, my breathing oppressed").
   - Attempts to find relief by leaving: wandering countryside, climbing cliffs, forcing through thorny thickets, becoming lacerated (illustrative quote: "I either wander through the country... force a path through the trackless thicket").
   - Collapse/exhaustion outdoors: lying stretched on the ground, dying with thirst, sleeping till break of day beneath a tree in a forest (illustrative quote: "I sleep till break of day").
   - Comparison of suffering to religious asceticism and conclusion of hopelessness: hermit's cell would be luxury; sees no end except the grave (illustrative quote: "I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave.").
   - Completed tasks: None observed.
   - ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
   - Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense obsession, melancholy, despair; high intensity.
   - Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing (expects only grave); all-or-nothing/selective attention (surroundings matter only in relation to her). *(inferred)*
   - Coping Strategies: leaving the situation physically; vigorous physical exertion (climbing, wandering); self-inflicted physical suffering via thorns; crying and seeking Charlotte’s sympathy (bathing her hand with tears); sleeping outdoors to recover.
   - Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: None observed.

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
   - Routines: physical escape through walking/climbing; exposure to thorns and physical injury; lying down from exhaustion; sleeping outdoors until morning.
   - Numeric metrics verbatim: None specified.

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   - Obsessive attachment to a single person (Charlotte/her).
   - Seeking bodily/physical extremes as relief from emotional anguish.
   - Sense of self-deception and inability to break the cycle of longing and despair.

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
   - Persistent rumination about “her.”
   - Habitual physical flight from emotional pain (wandering, climbing, forcing through thickets).
   - Use of self-inflicted physical hardship as emotional regulation.
   - Reliance on tears and hoped-for sympathy from Charlotte.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The author recognizes self-deception ("Why do I thus deceive myself?"), acknowledges compulsive impulses, and perceives no solution beyond death.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What small, safe action could interrupt the cycle when you feel compelled to tear yourself away?
   - What does “relief” feel like to you, and how might you access it without self‑harm?
   - When you say you deceive yourself, what truth do you most want to face?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - None observed.
