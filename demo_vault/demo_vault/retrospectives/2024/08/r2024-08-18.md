**Key Events**
- Recollection of intense childhood/earlier joy in nature: vivid sensory descriptions of mountains, valleys, birds, insects, river, and forests (quote: "filled and glowed within my heart").
- Peak awe/exaltation at perceiving the divine in nature; sense of the infinite (quote: "the glorious forms of an infinite universe became visible to my soul").
- Present shift to suffering: past delight now "an insupportable torment" that persecutes the author (quote: "the source of our happiness must also be the fountain of our misery").
- Attempt at consolation through memory and expression: recalling those hours consoles and exalting the soul when uttered (quote: "doubly feel the intensity of my present anguish").
- Philosophical reflection on transience and destruction: time carries all things onward; every act destroys life (quote: "time, with the speed of a storm, carries all things onward").
- Conclusion of horror at nature’s self‑consumption: the universe is a devouring monster (quote: "a fearful monster, for ever devouring its own offspring").
- Completed tasks: None observed.
