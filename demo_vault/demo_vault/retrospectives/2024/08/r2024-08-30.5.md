# r2024-08-30

1. **Key Events**
- Intense, obsessive longing and self-reproach; imagines nothing but Charlotte, prays only to her (“I cannot pray except to her.”)
- Physical/psychological crisis after prolonged company: excitation, dim sight, confused hearing, oppressed breathing, aching heart (“my sight grows dim, my hearing confused”)
- If sympathy is denied, forced withdrawal into nature: wandering, climbing cliffs, forcing through thickets to obtain relief (“I feel compelled to tear myself from her”)
- Physical collapse and sleep outdoors: lying stretched, dying with thirst, sleeping till break of day under a tree (“I sleep till break of day.”)
- Suicidal/desperate outlook: compares self to hermit, sees no end except the grave (“I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave.”)
- Completed tasks: None observed.
- ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity – desperate, anguished, obsessive; intensity described as very high (phrases like “highest excess,” “wretchedness”).
- Cognitive Distortions – self‑deception (“deceive myself”), catastrophic thinking (“no end… except the grave”).
- Coping Strategies – seeking Charlotte’s sympathy; physical escape into nature (wandering, climbing, thicket), sleeping outdoors to recover.

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**

- Seeking physical solitude and bodily hardship (thorns, cliffs) to relieve emotional pain.

- The author recognizes and names self‑deception and the obsessive absorption in Charlotte, acknowledges severe physical and mental consequences, and concludes that only death seems an end.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
