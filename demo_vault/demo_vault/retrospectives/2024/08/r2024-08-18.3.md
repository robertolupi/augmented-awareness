1. **Key Events**
   - Past ecstatic communion with nature: intense sensory and spiritual joy while observing mountains, valleys, rivers, birds, insects, and plants ( "the full and ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of nature" ).
   - Present shift to anguish: that same love has transformed into ongoing torment and persecution ( "has now become an insupportable torment" ).
   - Recollection and expression: recalling past sensations consoles and exalts the soul, and the author attempts to give them utterance ( "the bare recollection of those hours still consoles me" ).
   - Existential dread and imagery of destruction: perception of life as transient, time as a storm, and an ever‑open grave before him ( "the abyss of an ever open grave yawned before me" ).
   - Reflection on nature’s consuming power: observation that nature consumes itself and its offspring, turning the universe into a fearful monster ( "Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself" ).
