1. **Key Events**
- Intense, obsessive longing for a woman dominates the author’s imagination; surrounding objects matter only as they relate to her.
- After spending several hours with her, the author becomes physically and emotionally overwhelmed: dimmed sight, confused hearing, oppressed breathing, aching heart.
- When sympathy is not received from Charlotte, the author compels himself to leave and seeks relief through solitary physical exertion: wandering the country, climbing precipitous cliffs, forcing paths through thickets (resulting in lacerations), lying stretched and exhausted, sometimes dying with thirst, or sleeping against an aged tree until dawn.
- Expresses extreme despair and sees no end except the grave.
- List of completed tasks: None observed.
- ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Intense obsession, melancholy, despair, and physical panic-like symptoms (described as “highest excess,” “wretchedness”).
- Cognitive Distortions: obsessive focus on beloved *(inferred)*; catastrophic expectation of only death as an end *(inferred)*.
- Coping Strategies: seeking physical escape into nature, self-exertion (climbing, wandering), somatic punishment via thorns/briers, crying for sympathy from Charlotte.
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: Recognition of self-deception and suffering is present; no explicit self-compassion expressed.

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
- Routines: episodes of prolonged social/emotional immersion followed by solitary, physically taxing escapes; occasional nocturnal sleep outdoors until dawn.
- Numeric metrics verbatim: Not specified.

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
- Obsessive, all-consuming romantic passion; reliance on one person (Charlotte) for consolation; use of solitary, bodily hardship in nature as relief; recurrent self-reproach and despair.

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
- Habitual tearing oneself away after emotional overwhelm; habitual retreat into remote natural settings; deliberate exposure to physical pain (thorns/briers) and exhaustion as soothing measures; seeking tears/sympathy from Charlotte.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
- The author is aware of self-deception (“Why do I thus deceive myself?”) and recognizes a recurring compulsion driven by the heart (“to what does not my heart often compel me!”), yet perceives no resolution.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
- What, besides solitude and physical exertion, has ever brought you sustained relief?
- How might you respond differently if Charlotte cannot or will not offer the consolation you seek?
- What small acts of self-care could interrupt the cycle before it becomes physically harmful?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
- When overwhelmed by longing and denied sympathy, remove oneself from Charlotte and seek solitude in nature (wandering, climbing, or finding a secluded spot to rest), as previously practiced.
- Use physical exhaustion and secluded sleep as primary means to gain temporary relief (as described).
