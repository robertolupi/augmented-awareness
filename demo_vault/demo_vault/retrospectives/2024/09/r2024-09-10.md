1. **Key Events**
- Evening on the terrace under tall chestnut trees and beech avenue: Werther waits, watches sunset, remembers prior visits with Charlotte, and feels secret foreboding about the gloomy recess. (quote: "it has all the charm of a mysterious solitude.")
- Meeting with Charlotte and Albert at moonrise in the avenue/recess: Werther greets them, sits, is restless and agitated, and the conversation turns to moonlight, death, and reunion. (quote: "Whenever I walk by moonlight, it brings to my remembrance...")
- Charlotte recounts her mother's dying blessing and charges her to care for her siblings; Albert and Charlotte show strong emotion. (quote: "Be you a mother to them.")
- Werther declares belief they will meet again, seizes Charlotte’s hand, weeps, and ultimately watches her depart through the garden gate; he resolves to leave. (quote: "We shall see each other again—here and hereafter we shall meet again.")

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity – intense agitation, melancholy, restlessness, misery, trembling, and profound longing (high intensity; many tears).
- Cognitive Distortions – Not specified.
- Coping Strategies – emotional expression through weeping, physical movement (walking, running), seeking solitude in a favored landscape, confessing feelings aloud.
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – recognizes his own courage for not betraying his intention; finds some consolation in hope of reunion.

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
- Routines – Not specified.
- Numeric metrics verbatim – "two hours' duration"; "half an hour"; "six months"; "tomorrow"; "at sunrise the horses are to be at the door."

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
- Moonlight, death/futurity, memory of loved ones, the romanticized landscape (terrace/avenue/gloomy recess), and separation. Author references prior description: "I have mentioned all this in a former letter."

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
- Frequent visits to the same romantic spot; pacing and restlessness during emotional distress; openly weeping and dramatic physical gestures (throwing himself on the ground, seizing hands).

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
- The author is aware of his intense emotions, acknowledges his courage in concealing his intention during the interview, senses a foreboding tied to the place, and repeatedly frames departure as both willful and uncertain ("going willingly; but, should I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word").

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
- What would make departure feel less like a final severance for you?
- How might you honor the memory and promises discussed without being consumed by the loss?
- In what ways could the favorite places that comfort you also be used to process this grief?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
- Depart at sunrise; "the horses are to be at the door" (plan to leave).
- Maintain resolve to leave without betraying his intention (he states he had "the courage" not to betray it).
- Charlotte's intended commitment (stated in the narrative): "Be you a mother to them." (future‑oriented promise)
