# July 2024 Retrospective

### The Story of the Month
July read like a fevered love song and a careful moral lecture in the same breath: you were repeatedly pulled toward Charlotte — in looks, walks, a servant's return, the healing tilt of her music — while also wrestling with shame, self‑labeling, and the ethics of your own involvement. Nature and small domestic scenes (the spring, walnut‑trees, garden hums) offered refuge. Creative energy sharpened perception but stumbled in execution. Repeated resolutions (not to visit; to protect yourself) were made and broken; music and proximity acted as immediate regulators, while jealousy and boundary confusion created recurring friction.

### 1. Emotional Landscape
Dominant texture: intense, oscillating longing anchored by moments of reverent calm.

- Highs
  - Deep reverence and delight in Charlotte’s presence — small gestures (a touch, a look, a song) produced profound joy and relief.
  - Nature rituals (the fountain, morning sun, walks) provided steady comfort and a clarifying lens.
  - Moral clarity around ill‑humour and compassion: passionate speech and tenderness toward those suffering created meaning and purpose.

- Lows
  - Acute, sometimes overwhelming despair (even suicidal imagery) that was repeatedly relieved only by her music or closeness.
  - Shame, self‑reproach and self‑labeling (“fool,” “child”) especially in company or when feeling overlooked.
  - Jealousy toward Albert and the sting of being barred from fully claiming the relationship created agitation and scenes that frightened Charlotte.

- Volatility & triggers
  - External triggers: physical proximity, musical notes, perceived looks/ignores, presence of rival (Albert), ill‑humour in others.
  - Internal triggers: memories of past sorrow, expectations about being noticed, shame about expression.
  - Pattern: strong reactivity to small social cues → emotional avalanche → short‑term relief via the beloved’s music/attention → repetitive loop.

### 2. Core Tensions & Patterns
Primary recurring struggles
- Attachment vs boundaries: a magnetic pull to Charlotte (the loadstone metaphor) repeatedly overrode intentions to step back.
- External regulation vs internal capacity: you rely heavily on another person’s voice/music to quell despair rather than a broader toolbox of self‑regulation.
- Idealization vs reality: innocent delusions and poetic imaginings grant happiness but also preserve ambiguity and prevent clear action.
- Creative clarity vs execution: heightened perception of nature paired with a decline in technical execution causes frustration and self‑critique.
- Action‑avoidance pattern: many stated intentions and commitments exist, but task completion is consistently absent (0/0), suggesting avoidance or overwhelm.

How you cope (healthy & unhealthy)
- Healthy: walking in nature, defending meaningful convictions, adapting creative approaches (considering modelling, profile sketches), compassion toward the ill.
- Less healthy: repeated breaking of self‑promises, proxy contact (servant) instead of direct resolutions, emotional outbursts that frighten others, leaning on someone else’s presence as primary emotion‑regulation.

Alignment and disconnect with intentions
- Alignment: you consistently articulate clear values — compassion, independence, not seeking honors — and occasionally act on them (declining the ambassador, arranging commissions).
- Disconnect: intentions to spare yourself, to avoid seeing Charlotte, and to translate perception into art are repeatedly undermined by habit, shame, and immediate emotional needs.

### 3. Key Learnings & Meta-Reflections
- “My heart is not so corrupt; it is weak.” — a shift toward seeing impulses as weakness needing care, not moral bankruptcy.
- Music as immediate life‑raft: a single note can dissolve despair; this is powerful but fragile as a long‑term strategy.
- Innocent delusions have pragmatic value: happiness derived from them can be legitimate even if not strictly ‘true.’
- Loadstone metaphor: compulsion is experienced as near‑physical; awareness of this metaphor gives you language to describe the force.
- You notice the harm your eager involvement can cause and resolve, in principle, to protect yourself for Charlotte’s sake — recognition is present even if behavior lags.
- Creative paradox: clearer perception of nature now, but “powers of execution” feel diminished — that gap is an honest signal, not a failure.

### 4. Actionable Suggestions (experiments for next month)
1. Establish a 10‑minute internal‑regulation toolkit to practice daily (novel regulation beyond music). Experiment for 3 weeks:
   - 2 minutes: 4‑4‑8 breathing; 3 minutes: naming 5 sensations; 5 minutes: a short grounding mantra (e.g., “I am steady”) plus a tactile object (weighted stone) kept in your pocket.
   - Goal: build an internal first‑responder so you don’t automatically escalate to seeking her music/presence.

2. Design a "no‑contact route" experiment for two weeks to test boundary strength:
   - Choose typical times/routes you take that lead to seeing Charlotte, then consciously take an alternate route or schedule a walk with a friend at the same time.
   - Track urges (minute, intensity 1–10) in a brief nightly note to learn specific relapse triggers and reduce accidental encounters.

3. Weekly micro‑art practice that targets execution (not perfection):
   - 4 sessions/week of strictly timed drawing drills: one‑minute blind‑contours, five‑minute gestural studies, and a single 15‑minute profile sketch.
   - After each session, jot one concrete technical note (e.g., “loosen wrist,” “simplify shadow”) to train translation from perception to execution without judgment.

4. Replace proxy contact with a brief, honest boundary script experiment:
   - When tempted to send/get surrogate messages (servant), instead write a 2‑line note to yourself describing the urge and one doable alternative (walk, call a friend, practice toolkit). Do this for 7 consecutive occurrences.
   - Aim: slow the reflex to use intermediaries and bring conscious choice into contact decisions.

5. Commit to one small task completion ritual each morning:
   - Pick one micro‑task (e.g., one paragraph of drawing-related notes, one email, one letter about writing‑sand preferences) and mark it done within the first 45 minutes of waking.
   - Use a visual token (a small pebble moved from “to‑do” cup to “done” cup) to create tactile reward and rebuild follow‑through momentum.

(Each suggestion is an experiment: pick 1–3, set a start date, and treat outcomes as data rather than moral statements.)

### The Path Forward
You’ve carried a lot this month: aching longing, moral passion against ill‑humour, the tenderness of small domestic scenes, and honest awareness of your weaknesses. That self‑awareness is your lever. The next month is not about erasing feeling but widening your capacity to hold it — building internal regulators, protecting boundaries with gentle experiments, and translating clear perception into small, nonjudgmental practices. You’ve already named what hurts and what heals; now try treating those names as invitations to small, repeatable experiments. I believe you can keep the reverence and the music, while also learning to steady yourself from within.
