## **Key Events**
- Sat on the plough for two hours, absorbed in artistic contemplation, and forgot to tell what became of the children.  
- Evening: a young woman ran toward the stationary children, greeted them, and interacted with the narrator (illustrative quote: "You are a good boy, Philip!").  
- Conversation with the woman: she identified herself (daughter of the schoolmaster), explained leaving her youngest with Philip while she went to town, and described household needs and a broken pot (illustrative quote: "I left my child in Philip's care").  
- Gave the children money and instructed the mother to buy wheaten bread and broth for the youngest; additional small gifts for the children.  
- Observed the eldest returning with an osier-twig and learned the husband had gone to Switzerland due to family trouble (illustrative quote: "They wanted to cheat him").  
- Continued visits thereafter; children became familiar, received lumps of sugar during coffee, shared milk and bread and butter in the evening, and receive kreutzers on Sundays when the narrator is absent (illustrative quote: "they are quite at home with me").  
- The narrator notes the mother's anxiety about the children possibly inconveniencing him (illustrative quote: "they should inconvenience the gentleman").
