1. **Key Events**
   - Found a snug, comfortable spot near Walheim and described its setting and charms (linden-trees, small inn, retired green).
   - Used the little inn: brings table and chair outside, drinks coffee, reads Homer.
   - Encountered a deserted afternoon scene: a four-year-old holding a six-month-old; sketched the scene from nature. (illustrative quote: "the sight charmed me")
   - Completed a careful drawing in about an hour, without adding anything of his own; resolved to adhere entirely to nature in future work.
   - Reflected on rules vs. nature and how rules can stifle genius; offered an analogy with love and a worldly advisor. (illustrative quote: "that this is too hard...") (illustrative quote: "love is natural; but you must love within bounds.")
