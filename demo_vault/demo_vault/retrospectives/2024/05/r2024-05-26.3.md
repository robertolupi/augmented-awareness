1. **Key Events**
   - Discovered a snug cottage spot near Walheim, a hill-side village with two linden trees and a small inn where an old woman "sells wine, beer, and coffee" (cheerful and pleasant).  
   - Spent time at the inn bringing out table and chair, drank coffee, read Homer, and sketched a scene of two children alone in the deserted green; "The sight charmed me." (short: "The sight charmed me.")  
   - Made a careful drawing from nature in about an hour and resolved to adhere entirely to nature in future artistic practice.  
   - Reflected and argued against artistic/societal rules, using an analogy about a worldly adviser limiting love and genius ("love is natural; but you must love within bounds."). (short: "love is natural; but you must love within bounds.")  
   - Criticized "cold and respectable persons" who restrain the torrent of genius by building embankments. (short: "their summer-houses and tulip-beds would suffer")
