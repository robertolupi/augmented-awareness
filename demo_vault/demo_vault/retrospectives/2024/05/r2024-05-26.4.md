1. **Key Events**
   - Discovered a snug, comfortable cottage‑like spot near town and described the place called Walheim (about a league from the town).  
   - Visited the little inn run by a good old woman who “sells wine, beer, and coffee, and is cheerful and pleasant.”  
   - Sat outside on the green beneath two linden‑trees; had table and chair brought out, drank coffee, and read Homer.  
   - Found the village deserted; observed a small boy (four years) holding a six‑month‑old child, sketched the scene from nature for about an hour (sketching described as “with great delight”).  
   - Resolved to adhere entirely to nature in future artistic work; argued that rules and social decorum destroy genuine natural feeling. (short illustrative quote: “they only restrain and prune superfluous branches”)  
   - Presented analogy about love vs. social moderation to illustrate how societal rules dam up genius. (short illustrative quote: “love is natural; but you must love within bounds”)
