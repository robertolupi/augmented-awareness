There's a melancholic, empathetic tone when reflecting on the garden's former master.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers**: The acknowledgment of a "habit" of ruminating on "every petty vexation" suggests a tendency towards mental distress or obsessive thought patterns, though not explicitly burnout.
*   **Positive moments**: Feeling happy about a new start; finding solitude a "genial balm"; being cheered by the spring and nature's beauty; successful resolution of a significant family financial issue; finding a new favorite place for reflection and anticipating a sense of belonging/ownership.
*   **Negative spirals**: Engages in self-accusation and prolonged rumination over past romantic interactions and perceived faults (Leonora). Explicitly states a past habit of "ruminate on every petty vexation."
