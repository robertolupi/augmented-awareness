   - Romanticizing and preserving idealized images; self‑deprecating about storytelling.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The narrator recognizes a pattern of turning real scenes into poetic idealizations, admits extravagance and narrative shortcomings, and fears that direct observation might spoil an imagined perfection.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What would change in your perception if you actually met the widow versus keeping the image formed through the peasant’s eyes?
   - How does your tendency to idealize influence your interactions and storytelling?
   - When is preservation of an ideal more beneficial than seeking fuller knowledge? *(inferred)*
