2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity – explicit emotions: "happy and contented mortal," intense infatuation/captivation ("has captivated all my senses"), excitement, agitation, overwhelmed ("sank under them," "stream of delicious tears").

- Numeric metrics verbatim: "eight brothers and sisters!"; "Six children, from eleven to two years old"; "Sophy, a girl about eleven years old"; "a little fair-haired girl, about six years old"; "a youth of fifteen"; "third country dance".

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
- Prior acquaintance with S— and an earlier invitation is referenced ("I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with S—").
- Repeated idealization of a woman and romance/dance as central motifs.
- Storm interrupting social pleasure appears as a disrupting motif.

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
- Impulsivity to leave work and ride out ("three times on the point of throwing down my pen...").
- Persistent staring/gazing at Charlotte ("steadfastly I gazed upon her rich dark eyes").
- Emotional expressiveness: public weeping, dramatic vows, kissing hands and children.
- Social facilitation: organizing or joining games and dances.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
- The narrator recognizes his own poor capacity as a historian of his feelings ("I am a happy and contented mortal, but a poor historian") and notices his tendency to be overwhelmed and to idealize (“impossible to tell you how perfect she is”).

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
- How can I describe Charlotte more concretely rather than relying on idealizing language?
- What are the consequences of acting on immediate impulses (riding out, declaring vows) versus pausing to reflect?
- How might I respond to learning she is engaged while respecting her situation?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
- "I will compel myself to give you the details" — intent to provide a fuller account to Wilhelm (presented as a commitment).
- Vow to prevent any maiden he loves from waltzing with another ("never, never should waltz with any one else but with me") — stated future intention.
