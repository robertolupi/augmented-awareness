### Key Events
- Physician visit: the town physician visited the judge, found the narrator on the floor playing with Charlotte's children; some children scrambled over him and others romped; he caught and tickled them while rebuilding their card houses. The physician disapproved and later complained in town that Werther was "completely ruining them."  
- Response to criticism: narrator was aware the doctor thought his conduct beneath dignity but did not let it disturb him; allowed the doctor to continue speaking while he rebuilt the card houses for the children.  
- Reflective passage on children and adults: narrator expresses deep feeling for children, sees virtues in them and cites the Great Teacher: ("Unless ye become like one of these!"). He criticizes adults who treat children as subjects and questions adults' exclusive right to will.  
- Closing: narrator ends with "Adieu, Wilhelm" and states he will not further bewilder himself with the subject.
