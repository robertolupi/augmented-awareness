1. **Key Events**
- The physician visited the judge and found the narrator on the floor playing with Charlotte's children; the children scrambled over and romped with him while he caught and tickled them.
- The physician, a formal person who "adjusts the plaits of his ruffles," considered the narrator's conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man; the narrator perceived this by his countenance but was not disturbed.
- While the doctor spoke, the narrator rebuilt the children's card houses as fast as they threw them down.
- The doctor later complained around town that the judge's children were spoiled before and now Werther was "completely ruining them." (doctor: "Werther was completely ruining them.")
- The narrator reflects on his deep affection for children and their virtues, invoking the Great Teacher: "Unless ye become like one of these!" (quote: "Unless ye become like one of these!")
