# Key Events
- Late-night writing and sleep: went to bed at two in the morning; "I might have talked instead of writing to you" (excerpt).  
- Return from the ball at sunrise: experienced a "most magnificent sunrise" with rain falling from forest trees; companions asleep.  
- Interaction with Charlotte en route and at her door: Charlotte asked if he wished to sleep and begged him "not to make any ceremony on her account"; he responded, "As long as I see those eyes open" (excerpt). They remained awake until her door; the maid reported her father and children were well and sleeping.  
- Visit arranged/completed: he asked permission to visit her during the day, she consented, and he went. He reports afterward that "the whole world is nothing to me" (excerpt).  
- Completed tasks: None observed.
