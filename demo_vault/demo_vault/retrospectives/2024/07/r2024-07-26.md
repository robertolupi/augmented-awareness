1. **Key Events**
   - Resolved not to see "her" so frequently but repeatedly fails to keep the resolution; each tomorrow the author promises to stay away and then goes to see her.
   - Reasons given for visiting: she says "You will be sure to call to-morrow," (You will be sure to call to-morrow), she gives commissions requiring an in‑person answer, or a fine day prompts a walk to Walheim and a short extra walk to her.
   - Walk to Walheim; when there, it's "only half a league farther to her" (half a league).
   - Recounts grandmother's story of a loadstone that draws ironwork off ships, causing disaster.
   - Completed tasks: None observed.
   - ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
   - Mood Spectrum & Intensity – conflicted about avoidance versus attraction; experiences persistent temptation and inability to adhere to resolutions.
   - Cognitive Distortions – Not specified. (Possible rationalizations and justifications are present) *(inferred)*
   - Coping Strategies – makes firm resolutions to avoid contact; promises to stay away "to‑morrow"; uses errands or weather as reasons to go (rationalizations) *(inferred)*.
   - Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – Not specified. (Awareness of a repeated pattern suggests opportunity for change) *(inferred)*

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
   - Routines: takes walks; goes to Walheim when the day is fine.
   - Numeric metrics verbatim: "half a league."

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   - Repeated failure to keep a personal resolution; temptation and irresistible attraction.
   - Use of practical reasons (commissions, weather, errands) to justify visits.
   - Family storytelling used as metaphor (grandmother's loadstone story).

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
   - Making and breaking resolutions to avoid the person.
   - Accepting commissions or errands as pretexts to visit.
   - Walking to Walheim and extending the walk to visit her.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The author explicitly recognizes the pattern: deliberate intention not to visit, repeated promises, and recurring, almost automatic return to her side; views the attraction as a "charmed atmosphere."

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What specific triggers make me break my resolution and go to her?
   - Which practical steps could prevent the walk-to-Walheim → visit sequence?
   - How does the grandmother's loadstone story reflect my own experience?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - Resolve not to see her (intention stated: to stay away "to‑morrow").
   - Consider identifying and altering the routines (walks/errands) that lead to visits *(inferred)*.
