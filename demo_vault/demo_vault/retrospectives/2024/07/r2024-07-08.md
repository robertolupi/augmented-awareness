1. **Key Events**
   - Went to Walheim; the ladies rode in a carriage while the author walked with others. (Illustrative quote: "What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look!")  
   - Stood with young W. Seldstadt and Andran near the carriage door; the group laughed and joked. (Illustrative quote: "They are a merry set of fellows, and they were all laughing and joking together.")  
   - Watched Charlotte’s dark eyes closely; she did not seem to look at the author, who remained motionless and focused on her. (Illustrative quote: "They did not light on me, on me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her!")  
   - Carriage drove off; the author’s eyes filled with tears and he looked after Charlotte. (Illustrative quote: "My eyes filled with tears.")  
   - Saw Charlotte’s bonnet lean out of the window and she turned to look back; author is uncertain whether she looked at him and finds consolation in that uncertainty. (Illustrative quote: "Perhaps she turned to look at me. Perhaps!")  
   - Completed tasks: None observed (- [x] entries: None).

   - Coping Strategies: Finds consolation in uncertainty; introspection; seeking forgiveness ("but forgive me!").
