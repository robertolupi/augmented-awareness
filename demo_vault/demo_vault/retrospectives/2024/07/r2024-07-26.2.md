6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What specific triggers (request, commission, weather) most reliably lead you to break your resolution?
   - How does describing the attraction as a "loadstone" change how you think about control or responsibility?
   - What small practical step could interrupt the pattern when you feel the pull to visit?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - Repeated promise/intention to "stay away" tomorrow (expressed as a future resolution in the text).
