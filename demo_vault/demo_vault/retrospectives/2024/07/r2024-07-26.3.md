1. **Key Events**
   - Repeated attempts to avoid seeing "her"; daily exposure to temptation and failed resolutions. (Illustrative quote: "You will be sure to call to-morrow,")
   - Specific reasons for visits: prompted by her prior remark, given commissions that require in-person answers, or walking to Walheim and continuing the short distance to her.
   - Metaphorical story from grandmother about a mountain of loadstone that irresistibly pulls ironwork from ships.
   - Completed tasks: None.
   - ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   - Repeated failure to keep resolutions about avoiding someone.
   - Use of external reasons/excuses to justify behavior (prior request, commission, pleasant walk).
   - Magnetism/metaphor of irresistible pull (loadstone story).

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
   - Habitual visiting despite intent not to.
   - Forming daily pledges to change behavior, then reversing them.
   - Taking walks to Walheim that often lead to visiting her.
   - Accepting commissions that create obligations to appear in person.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The author recognizes a pattern: deliberate intent to stay away repeatedly overridden by an "irresistible" pull, likened to the loadstone that draws ironwork away.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What small changes might interrupt the chain of reasons that lead you to visit?
   - Which specific triggers (a comment, a commission, a walk) are easiest to modify or avoid?
   - How does the loadstone metaphor reflect how you experience control over this behavior?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - Intention stated: "to-morrow I will really stay away" (expressed pledge for future behavior).
