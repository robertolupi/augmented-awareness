1. **Key Events**
   - Intense physical/psychological reaction when touching or brushing feet under the table ("How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger").  
   - Withdrawal and repeated approach: author "draw[s] back as if from a furnace" then is "impel[led] forward again" (no direct quote in text beyond description).
   - Close contact during conversation: hand laid on author's, closeness and breath cause overwhelming sensations ("I feel as if lightning had struck me").
   - Moral self‑questioning about feelings and desire to confess or act ( "my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak" ).
   - Perception of the woman as sacred and calming; passion quiets in her presence ("She is to me a sacred being").
   - Music as immediate emotional regulator: piano playing dispels pain, care, and sorrow ("when she plays the first note, all pain, care, and sorrow disappear").  
   - Singing as crisis intervention: her song disperses gloom and suicidal madness ("instantly the gloom and madness are dispersed").
