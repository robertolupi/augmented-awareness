# r2024-07-24

1. **Key Events**
   - Main summary: The author reports neglecting drawing despite encouragement; feels heightened perception of nature but cannot translate it to clear drawing. (quote: "how little I have lately done")
   - Attempted medium change: Considers modelling in clay or wax (or kneading dough) if current state continues. (quote: "I shall try... and will take to modelling")
   - Portrait work: Began Charlotte's portrait three times and felt each attempt a failure; settled for a sketched profile. (quote: "I have as often disgraced myself")
   - Completed tasks:
     - [x] None observed.
   - ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
   - Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Mixed — explicitly "I never felt happier" alongside frustration and self‑criticism about execution.  
   - Cognitive Distortions: Negative global self‑evaluation ("my powers of execution are so weak") *(inferred: personalization/self‑blame from "disgraced myself")*.  
   - Coping Strategies: Considering switching to modelling; sketching a simpler profile as acceptable alternative.  
   - Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: Acceptance of a sketch ("must content myself with that"); openness to experimenting with other media.

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
   - Routines: Not specified.
   - Numeric metrics verbatim: None observed.

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   - Strong theme of heightened perception of nature paired with difficulty in execution.
   - Noted decline relative to past ability: "formerly very happy in taking likenesses."

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
   - Repeatedly starting and abandoning the same portrait (three attempts).
   - Pivoting to simpler studies (profile sketch).
   - Considering hands‑on tactile media (modelling with clay/wax or dough).

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   - The author is aware of a disconnect between increased perceptual understanding and weakened practical execution, and is proactively considering alternative media to bridge that gap.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   - What small modelling experiment could you try next to translate perception into form?
   - Which specific drawing exercises helped you previously with likenesses, and can you revisit them?
   - How might you honor your heightened perception while accepting imperfect execution today?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   - Try modelling (clay or wax) if the current state of mind persists.
   - Use dough as a readily available modelling material as a first experiment.
   - Continue with simpler studies (e.g., Charlotte's profile) rather than forcing full likenesses.
