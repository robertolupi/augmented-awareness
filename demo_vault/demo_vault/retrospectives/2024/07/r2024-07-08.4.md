1. **Key Events**
- Walk to Walheim with others; the ladies rode in a carriage while the narrator and fellow men stood by the carriage door. (I am a fool—but forgive me!)
- The group of men were laughing and joking; the narrator watched Charlotte’s dark eyes intensely and felt unnoticed. (they did not light on me, on me)
- The carriage drove off; the narrator’s eyes filled with tears as he watched it leave. (my eyes filled with tears)
- After the carriage left, the narrator saw Charlotte’s bonnet lean out and wondered if she looked back; he finds consolation in that uncertainty. (Perhaps she turned to look at me.)

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
