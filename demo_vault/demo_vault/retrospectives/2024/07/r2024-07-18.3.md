**Key Events**
- Could not meet Charlotte because the author was "prevented by company" (quote: "I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day.").
- Sent a servant to Charlotte's house to gain indirect contact and awaited his return (quote: "I sent my servant to her house").
- Experienced strong impatience while waiting and great joy on the servant's return (quote: "Oh, the impatience with which I waited"; "the joy with which I welcomed him!").
- Felt a desire to embrace and kiss the servant but refrained out of shame (quote: "I should certainly have caught him in my arms").
- Used a metaphor (Bonona stone) to describe how proximity to Charlotte's presence made the servant seem luminous and beloved (quote: "So was it with me and this servant.").
- Questioned whether a happiness-producing illusion can be considered a delusion (quote: "Can that be a delusion which makes us happy?").
- Completed tasks: None observed.
