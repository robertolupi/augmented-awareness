# r2024-07-24

1. **Key Events**
   * Admitted neglecting drawing despite being urged not to ("(you) insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing").  
   * Experienced heightened appreciation of nature but inability to translate it into drawing; considered switching media to modelling with clay/wax or dough ("my powers of execution are so weak").  
   * Attempted Charlotte's portrait three times and felt each attempt failed; settled for a profile sketch ("I have commenced Charlotte's portrait three times").  
   * Completed tasks:
     - None observed.
   * ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
   * Mood Spectrum & Intensity – Reports "never felt happier" alongside frustration and low confidence about artistic execution.
   * Cognitive Distortions – None explicitly named; *(inferred)* strong self‑criticism ("disgraced myself") and possible overgeneralization about abilities.
   * Coping Strategies – Considering modelling as an alternative medium; sketching a simpler profile; willingness to "knead dough" as substitute.
   * Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – Accepting a compromise (content with a profile) and open to trying new materials if current state persists.

3. **Physical Health & Sleep**
   * Routines – Not specified.
   * Numeric metrics – None specified.

4. **Recurring Themes & Patterns**
   * Tension between vivid perception of nature and difficulty executing drawings.
   * Reference to past competence: "formerly very happy in taking likenesses," contrasted with current struggles.
   * Willingness to try alternate methods when execution falters.

5. **Notable Behaviors or Habits**
   * Repeatedly restarting a portrait (three attempts).
   * Prefers sketching profiles when full likenesses fail.
   * Rapid self‑critique and readiness to switch medium (modelling, using dough).

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
   * Clear self‑awareness that perception has improved ("never understood nature better") while technical execution has declined; pragmatic openness to adapting tools and expectations.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
   * What specific steps could help translate your clearer perception of nature into firmer outlines?
   * Which modelling material would best bridge your perception and execution right now?
   * How might accepting smaller successes (like a profile) support your confidence in likeness work?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
   * Try modelling with clay or wax if the current mental state continues.
   * Use dough as an accessible substitute for modelling practice.
   * Continue with profile sketches as an acceptable interim outcome.
