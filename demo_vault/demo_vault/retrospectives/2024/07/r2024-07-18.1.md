1. Key Events
The author was prevented from seeing Charlotte by company.
The author sent their servant to Charlotte's house to see someone who had been near her.
The author waited impatiently for the servant's return and welcomed him with intense joy.

2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
Mood: Highly passionate, deeply yearning, intensely joyful, bordering on obsessive.
Stress/Burnout markers: While the inability to see Charlotte causes disappointment, the emotional response is channeled into a profound, almost euphoric experience upon the servant's return, rather than stress or burnout.
Positive moments: The overwhelming joy and happiness derived from the servant's return; the ability to find profound meaning and happiness in indirect connections; the philosophical reflection on whether happiness, even if "delusional," is valid.
Negative spirals: Not present; the initial disappointment of not seeing Charlotte is quickly transcended by finding an alternative source of joy.

3. Physical Health & Sleep
Not mentioned.

4. Recurring Themes
Not discernible from this standalone entry, but highlights a theme of intense, possibly unrequited or hindered, romantic longing and the profound impact of the beloved's presence (even indirectly).

5. Notable Behaviors
Sending a servant to simply be near someone who had been near Charlotte.
An intense emotional reaction to the servant, almost wanting to embrace and kiss him due to his indirect connection to Charlotte.
Assigning immense value to the servant and his apparel because of Charlotte's eyes having dwelled on them (object transference/idealization).

6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The core reflection is "Can that be a delusion which makes us happy?" This suggests that the source or objective reality of happiness might be less important than the subjective experience of joy itself. The author acknowledges the potential "delusion" but affirms the validity of the happiness it brings.
