   - Narrator notes Albert's consideration: he has not kissed Charlotte in narrator's presence; narrator feels gratitude ("Heaven reward him for it!").
   - Narrator esteems Albert; contrasts Albert's coolness with narrator's own impetuosity; admires that Albert is "free from ill-humour."
   - Narrator recognizes his attachment increases Albert's triumph and love; will not probe whether Albert teases Charlotte with jealousies.
   - Narrator accepts pleasure with Charlotte is over; describes feeling like a "silly fellow" when deprived of his love.

You terrify me when you are so violent.").
