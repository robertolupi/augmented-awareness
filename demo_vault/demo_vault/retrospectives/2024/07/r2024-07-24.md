# r2024-07-24

# Key Events
- Confession of neglecting drawing; author admits little recent drawing. ( "confess how little I have lately done." )
- Strong connection to nature and happiness, paired with inability to execute drawings. ( "I never felt happier...and yet I am unable to express myself." )
- Perceptual/technical difficulty: execution weak, lines unclear, images "swim and float." ( "my powers of execution are so weak" )
- Plans to try modelling with clay, wax, or kneaded dough if the state continues. ( "I shall try...will take to modelling" )
- Multiple attempts at Charlotte's portrait failed; settled for a profile sketch. ( "I have commenced Charlotte's portrait three times" )
- Completed tasks: None observed.
- ✓0/0 tasks completed

# Emotional/Mental Health Summary
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Explicitly "happier" than ever but also frustrated/annoyed by inability to express (both stated).
- Cognitive Distortions: None specified.
- Coping Strategies: Attempting different media (modelling with clay/wax/dough); simplifying subject to a profile sketch; persisting by multiple attempts.
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: Acceptance of a simpler outcome ("must content myself with that"); willingness to try new materials.

# Physical Health & Sleep
- Routines: Not specified.
- Numeric metrics verbatim: None.

# Recurring Themes & Patterns
- Struggle between inner perception/appreciation of nature and outward ability to render it.
- Repeated attempts and revision (multiple starts on the portrait).
- Reference to past competence: formerly successful at likenesses ("formerly very happy in taking likenesses").

# Notable Behaviors or Habits
- Repeatedly restarting a portrait (three attempts).
- Shifting mediums/approaches when execution falters (considering modelling).
- Accepting a simpler solution (profile sketch) when full portrait fails.

# Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition
- Author recognizes a clear mismatch: heightened perception and joy in observing nature but weakened technical execution; contemplates changing medium as a practical response.

# Self‑Reflection Questions
- What small practice or material switch could help translate perception into clearer outlines?
- How might modelling (clay/wax/dough) change your relationship to form and line?
- What can you salvage or learn from the three failed portrait attempts?

# Commitments / Action Items
- Try modelling (clay or wax) if the current state of mind continues.
- Use kneaded dough as an accessible modelling substitute if needed.
- Accept and work from Charlotte's profile sketch rather than forcing a full likeness.
