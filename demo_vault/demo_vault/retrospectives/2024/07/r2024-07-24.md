1. Key Events
*   Attempted Charlotte's portrait three times with unsatisfactory results.
*   Successfully sketched Charlotte's profile.
*   Considered exploring modelling (clay/wax/dough) as an alternative creative outlet due to current difficulties with drawing.

2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
*   **Mood:** Paradoxical state of deep happiness and understanding of nature, alongside profound frustration and a sense of inadequacy regarding artistic execution.
*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** Described "powers of execution are so weak," visual distortion ("everything seems to swim and float before me"), inability to create clear outlines, and feeling "disgraced."
*   **Positive moments:** "I never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even down to the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass."
*   **Negative spirals:** Repeated failure with portraiture leading to self-criticism and a perceived inability to express internal vision.

3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
*   Not mentioned.

4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   Ongoing struggle with consistent artistic output and execution, despite internal understanding and inspiration (implied by the opening statement about neglecting drawing).
*   Decline in a previously strong artistic skill (taking likenesses).

5. Notable Behaviors
*   Persistent attempts at a challenging task (Charlotte's portrait).
*   Adaptation and exploration of alternative methods when faced with obstacles (switching to profile sketch, contemplating modelling).
*   Self-critical assessment of artistic performance.

6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
*   The author recognizes a significant disconnect between their internal understanding and ability to execute in drawing, leading to an exploration of alternative creative outlets (modelling) as a potential solution or coping mechanism for this block. They also acknowledge a decline in a previously strong skill.
