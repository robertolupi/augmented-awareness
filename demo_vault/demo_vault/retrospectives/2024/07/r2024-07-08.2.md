2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**

   - Cognitive Distortions: self‑labeling ("I am a fool"); *(inferred)* possible mindreading/jumping to conclusions about others’ thoughts.
   - Coping Strategies: crying; finding consolation in uncertainty ("in this uncertainty I find consolation"); asking for forgiveness ("forgive me!"). *(inferred)* seeking social company by walking with others.
   - Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: recognition of childishness ("What a child I am!") and plea for forgiveness suggest space for self‑compassion and reflection.
