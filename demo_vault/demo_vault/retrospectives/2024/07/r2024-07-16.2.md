1. **Key Events**

   * ✓0/0 tasks completed

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
   * Mood Spectrum & Intensity – intense longing, agitation, agony, disordered senses; episodes of profound gloom and readiness to commit suicide; sudden relief when she sings.  
   * Cognitive Distortions – self-condemnation / moral judgment of his feelings ("my heart is... corrupt") *(inferred label: self-blame)*.  
   * Coping Strategies – withdrawal/physical distancing; seeking proximity despite distress; using her music as an emotional regulator.  
   * Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – attempts to distinguish "weak" from "corrupt" in self-assessment (author reframes feelings as weakness rather than corruption).

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
