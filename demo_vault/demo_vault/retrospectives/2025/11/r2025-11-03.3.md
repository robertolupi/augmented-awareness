2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity – wretched, despondent, bereft of joy; expresses deep suffering. (Intensity: severe) *(inferred)*
- Cognitive Distortions – "I am alone the cause of my own woe" (self-blame); "my heart is dead" (overgeneralization/catastrophizing) *(inferred)*
- Coping Strategies – prayer/imploring God; looking at nature; recalling past patience and gratitude.
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – remembrance of past gratitude and patience suggests a route to rekindle thankful perspective; explicit self‑compassion not stated.

7. **Self‑Reflection Questions**
- What small, concrete action might help reopen the capacity for gratitude I remember from "bygone days"?
- What would asking for support (beyond private prayer) look like for me right now?
- When, if ever, has nature or a daily routine produced even a small emotional shift for me?

8. **Commitments / Action Items**
