1. Key Events
    *   No external events are mentioned; the entry focuses on an internal emotional struggle.

2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
    *   **Mood**: Conflicted, resigned, possibly melancholic, with an attempt to intellectualize or humorize personal "troubles."
    *   **Stress/Burnout markers**: None explicitly stated.
    *   **Positive moments**: Attempting to "affect mirth" as a coping mechanism.
    *   **Negative spirals**: Experiencing a deeply felt longing for someone who is unavailable, leading to a sense of impossibility and conflict (feeling she belongs to him, but acknowledging she is "another's").

3. Physical Health & Sleep
    *   Not mentioned.

4. Recurring Themes
    *   The core theme is unrequited love or longing for an unavailable person ("she is another's"). This appears to be a significant personal struggle.

5. Notable Behaviors
    *   The author consciously "affects mirth over [their] troubles," indicating a deliberate coping strategy of forced cheerfulness or intellectual detachment.
    *   A tendency to analyze emotional states through rhetorical devices ("litany of antitheses").

6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
    *   The author demonstrates a clear understanding of their paradoxical emotional state: intense possessive feelings ("she often seems to belong to me") conflicting with the reality of the situation ("she is another's").
    *   There is awareness of their coping mechanism (affecting mirth) and a desire to further explore the complexity of their feelings through intellectual articulation (composing antitheses).
