   - Emotional deadness: senses his heart is "dead," cannot summon tears, feels hardened and unmoved. ("my heart is now dead")  
   - Nature observation: looks from window at hills, morning sun, winding stream and is unmoved by beauty. ("the morning sun breaking through the mists")  
   - Spiritual appeal: bends knee and implores God for the blessing of tears, perceives no divine response. ("implore God for the blessing of tears")

   - Coping Strategies – rumination, seeking solace in nature, prayer/pleading to God for emotional release.
