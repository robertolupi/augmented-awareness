1. **Key Events**
- Walk by the river at dinner-time because the author had no appetite; observed gloomy weather and a man in a tattered coat. (“I had no appetite.”)
- Approached the man (Henry) who was searching rocks for flowers; he described gardens, roses, honeysuckles, and inability to find flowers. (“I have been looking for them these two days.”)
- Learned the man promised a nosegay for his mistress and claimed many riches and hopes tied to the states-general. (“I had promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress.”)
- An old woman called the man “Henry,” identified him as her son, and explained his past year of raving and confinement in a madhouse; she said he had been calmer for about six months. (“Henry, Henry! where are you?”) / (“he was for one whole year quite raving”)
- The author gave the mother a piece of money and left hastily. (“I placed a piece of money in her hand.”)
- Reflective return to town: narrator compares his own hopelessness to the madman’s delusion and envies that delusion; defends pilgrims and expresses an appeal to God to be called back. (“I envy the delusion to which you are a victim.”)

- Coping Strategies – walking outdoors; giving alms (money to the mother); intellectual/philosophical reflection; appeal/prayer to God; sympathetic defense of pilgrimages.

6. **Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**

He expresses a conscious desire to return to God.
