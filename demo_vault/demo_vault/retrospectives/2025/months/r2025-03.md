# March 2025 Retrospective

### The Story of the Month
This month reads like a fast, hot oscillation between public humiliation and decisive escape: a humiliating assembly and a devastatingly raw encounter with Miss B pushed you into extreme emotional reactivity (rage, despair, suicidal imagery), followed later by a pragmatic, outwardly decisive choice to tender your resignation and accept the Prince’s invitation. The flavor of the month is intense sensitivity to social rank and opinion, alternating between dramatic inward collapse and an attempt to reclaim agency through action and movement.

### 1. Emotional Landscape
Dominant texture: high emotional volatility keyed to social evaluation.

- Highs
  - A palpable, tender connection with Miss B in the moment of crisis (she cried and wiped your tears) — a painful but intimate human contact.
  - The practical relief or possibility offered by the Prince’s invitation and your decisive act of tendering resignation — a concrete pathway out of the situation.

- Lows
  - Repeated experiences of shame, humiliation, and embitterment after the assembly (feeling publicly mocked).
  - Intense anguish that escalated into repeated suicidal imagery and violent fantasies (seizing a dagger, opening a vein).
  - A persistent self‑undermining narrative: “I am unable to do anything for myself,” and a sense that “everything conspires against me.”

- Volatility & triggers
  - Rapid swings from embittered withdrawal → high-arousal confrontation → collapse into despair. Primary triggers: perceived social disdain, gossip, and reputational threat. Literature/solitude briefly soothe but do not stabilize the high arousal.

### 2. Core Tensions & Patterns
Primary recurring struggles and how you responded:

- Sensitivity to social rank and shame vs. desire for dignity
  - Pattern: minor slights are experienced as sweeping public condemnation; this triggers intense rumination and dramatized internal narratives (“I detest the whole race,” “you alone are to blame”).
  - Coping: withdrawal (leaving the assembly), rumination, reading Homer for comfort. Healthy intent (to narrate events plainly to prevent attribution) coexists with impulsive confrontations that escalate emotions.

- Pride / impulsive temper vs. long-term reputation management
  - Pattern: a reactive streak (impetuous temper) leads to confrontations that inflame rather than resolve social wounds.
  - Disconnect: intention to present a sober, plain account conflicts with acts driven by passion and dramatics.

- Helplessness / self‑doubt vs. pragmatic action
  - Pattern: “I am unable to do anything for myself” sits alongside decisive behavior (tendering resignation, accepting patronage). You oscillate between disempowerment and concrete steps to change circumstance.
  - Alignment: action (resignation) aligns with desire to move; disconnect remains in internal voice of incompetence and dread about family fallout.

- Safety risk: suicidal ideation and violent fantasies
  - Pattern: repeated self-harm imagery during peak emotional states. Coping strategies in those moments were limited to solitude and literary distraction — inadequate for imminent risk.

### 3. Key Learnings & Meta-Reflections
- You can name the pattern: an “impetuous temper” that both protects pride and creates social consequences.
- You notice that literature (Homer) functions as a short-term anchor — it soothes but doesn’t resolve the underlying cycle.
- You recognize a recurrent storyline: “Everything conspires against me” — a cognitive lens that intensifies every social slight.
- You see both the pull of public opinion and an emerging willingness to act decisively (resignation, leaving with the Prince).
- Notable quotes/mental models you voiced:
  - “You know our ridiculous customs.” (context: social rules produce humiliation)
  - “Everything conspires against me.” (persecution narrative)
  - “I am unable to do anything for myself.” (global self-doubt)
  - “A hundred times have I seized a dagger.” (recurrent suicidal imagery)

### 4. Actionable Suggestions (experiments for next month)
These are novel, concrete experiments designed to reduce volatility, increase safety, and convert your decisive energy into stabilizing practices.

1. Establish an immediate Safety Plan + Trusted Contact routine (experiment for 2 weeks)
   - Write a one-page safety plan you keep physically with you: triggers, early warning signs, three grounding actions (e.g., 5‑minute breathing, walk, read a designated grounding passage), two people to call, and local emergency numbers.
   - Practice using it once so it feels automatic if distress spikes. If you have active suicidal thoughts again, contact local emergency services or a crisis line immediately.

2. “Humiliation Debrief” worksheet (3-minute ritual before action)
   - Before leaving, confronting, or writing about an offense, complete a 3‑question sheet: (1) What exactly happened? (2) What facts support “they intended harm”? (3) What alternative, less catastrophic explanations fit? Do this for 7 days to train the mind away from mind‑reading and catastrophizing.

3. Convert literary solace into a “Grounding Passage” ritual
   - Choose one short Homer's passage (or any text that calms you). Create a two-line paraphrase that you can read aloud for 2 minutes when overwhelmed. Pair this with a sensory action (holding a stone, stepping outside) to make it embodied rather than purely avoidant.

4. Two-week Micro‑competence Sprint (rebuild agency)
   - Pick 3 tiny, tangible tasks (each completable in <48 hours) that directly counter “I am unable…”. Examples: finish one letter to your mother that explains your decision calmly; organize one drawer; prepare and complete a short practical task related to your future with the Prince (pack a bag, inquire about dates). Celebrate completion — rewrite the inner narrative by stacking small wins.

5. Practice the “Pause and Plan” before social confrontation (7‑day experiment)
   - When you feel the impulse to confront someone, pause and: take three slow breaths, ask yourself “What outcome do I want?” and either (A) speak a pre‑written one-sentence script, (B) request a time to discuss later, or (C) leave the situation and use the Humiliation Debrief worksheet. This converts high-arousal reactivity into chosen action.

### The Path Forward
This month was intense and revealing: you felt profoundly wounded and yet you also moved — you confronted, you chose to leave, and you sought new ground with the Prince. That movement is important; it shows agency beneath the pain. The immediate priorities are safety and reducing the reactivity loop so your decisions are governed by strategy rather than crisis. Small experiments — a safety plan, a quick humiliation debrief, and short, competence-building tasks — can stabilize your inner weather and give your outward choices more power. You’ve done the hard work of noticing the patterns; next month, try treating those observations as data for deliberate experiments rather than ammunition for self‑condemnation. If suicidal thoughts return, please seek immediate help (local emergency services or a crisis line) and lean on a trusted person now. You’re carrying a lot; tending the safety and steadiness beneath that fierceness will let your decisive moves become lasting change.
