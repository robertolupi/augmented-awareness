# November 2025 Retrospective

### The Story of the Month
November reads like a concentrated interior storm: recurring waves of intense longing, chastened restraint, and deep existential despair threaded through moments of art, prayer, and fleeting tenderness. You oscillated between reverent self-restraint (vows, silence) and corrosive self-blame; sought consolation in music, poetry, walking and prayer; and repeatedly found yourself stuck in repetitive inner loops — “one hundred times,” sitting where she descended, kneeling to ask for tears. The month’s flavor is melancholic, devotional, and ruminative — full of feeling but often frozen in action.

### 1. Emotional Landscape
- Dominant texture: heavy melancholy punctuated by sharp, romantic longing and religious anguish.
- Highs (sources of connection and relief):
  - Tender moments of affection (being called “dear,” shared looks).
  - Small consolations: music, poetry, walking, and brief acts of charity (giving alms).
  - A felt reverence for faith and a capacity to endure (“still strength enough for endurance”).
- Lows (sources of distress and depletion):
  - Deep wretchedness, self‑blame and feelings of unique, incomparable suffering.
  - Suicidal ideation / dark wishes on waking and chronic numbness (“my heart is dead”).
  - Energy depletion and increased alcohol use; appetite loss and physical malaise on some days.
  - Envy of another’s delusion as a heartbreaking sign of longing for relief.
- Emotional volatility and triggers:
  - Triggers: small interpersonal cues (a look, a hand seized), reminders of the beloved, moments of solitude/bedtime, and perceived spiritual estrangement.
  - Volatility: intense swings between reverent endurance and desperate hopelessness; rumination amplifies each swing.

### 2. Core Tensions & Patterns
- Primary recurring struggles:
  - Longing vs. restraint: powerful desire for intimacy repeatedly met by vows of restraint and moral/ideological prohibitions.
  - Agency vs. surrender: frequent descriptions of being “prostrated” or “able to do with me what she pleases” show a loss of felt agency.
  - Self‑blame and singular wretchedness: an inner narrative claiming that you alone are uniquely miserable keeps you isolated and magnifies distress.
  - Rumination and repetition: repeated self-talk, replaying phrases and scenes, sitting at meaningful spots — mental looping rather than forward movement.
  - Coping via avoidance: prayer, silence, affected mirth, walking, and increased wine consumption function intermittently as soothing strategies — some helpful, some harmful when relied upon exclusively.
- How you coped (healthy vs. unhelpful):
  - Healthy: seeking solace in music/poetry, giving to others, confiding in a friend (Wilhelm), practicing restraint when wanting to preserve another’s autonomy.
  - Unhelpful: bed-bound dark wishes and passive rumination; increasing alcohol use as self-medication; isolation and repeated cognitive loops that intensify despair.
- Alignment and disconnect between intention and action:
  - Alignment: intention to preserve the other’s purity and to endure suffering matched real vows and appeals to faith.
  - Disconnect: desire to rekindle gratitude and regain agency did not translate into concrete behaviour changes; repeated “no tasks completed” suggests avoidance of practical steps that could shift mood or health.

### 3. Key Learnings & Meta-Reflections
- You repeatedly notice the pattern: I can both create my own joy and be the source of my own woe.
- Restraint and reverence can be noble, but when mixed with rumination they calcify into suffering rather than wisdom.
- Art and ritual (music, poetry, walking, giving) reliably soothe — they are portable tools you already return to.
- The envy you feel toward the deluded is less moral failing and more a signal: you crave relief, permission to rest, and compassionate release.
- Repetition and self-talk reveal an unmet need: your inner life seeks being witnessed and brought into deliberate, contained form (e.g., a letter, a ritual).
- Faith is both comfort and question: you lean on religious language even as you fear being forsaken; this ambivalence is a doorway, not a dead end.
- Small sensory anchors (the window, the river, a hand) hold outsized emotional power — they can be used as leverage for deliberate experiments.

### 4. Actionable Suggestions
These are brief, time‑boxed experiments — pick one or two to try next month. Treat each as a 2–4 week trial and note effects in journal entries.

1. Safety & Support First (non-negotiable experiment)
   - If suicidal thoughts or dark waking wishes recur with intensity, create an immediate safety plan this week: identify one trusted person (Wilhelm or another), the local crisis number, and a safe place to go. Schedule a same-week check-in with a mental-health professional or crisis service. Safety is a necessary foundation for any other work.

2. “Three-Minute Breaker” for Rumination (behavioral activation)
   - When you notice repetitive thoughts or “saying it a hundred times,” interrupt the loop with a brief physical ritual: 3 minutes of focused breath + a short, brisk walk outside or 30 body‑scanning breaths while holding a small stone. Do this 3× per day. Log mood pre/post for one week to see if the loop loosens.

3. Letter Ritual: Contain the Desire
   - Write 2 letters (no sending): one to Charlotte that permits full feeling (say everything), one to yourself offering measured compassion and instruction. After each, choose one ritual: lock in a box, burn safely, or read aloud then place under pillow. This transforms repetition into contained action and gives your longing a structure that’s not enacted on the beloved.

4. Alcohol Reduction Experiment with Replacement Ritual
   - Design a one‑month “alcohol‑light” plan: choose 3 evenings per week to replace wine with a curated replacement (tonic + citrus, a non‑alcoholic herbal infusion) followed by a 20‑minute consoling activity (listen to a favorite piano piece, 15-minute walk, or a short poem). Track energy and mood each morning for two weeks to test causality.

5. Agency Micro‑Practice: The 1‑Sentence Assertive Rehearsal
   - Once every other day, practice a single, simple assertive phrase in front of a mirror or to a friend: e.g., “I need a little time to myself,” or “Thank you, but that’s not mine to take.” Deliver it aloud 3 times, noting physical sensations. This small rehearsal is a muscle for reclaiming agency that has felt surrendered.

(Optional) Gentle Clinical/Somatic Route
   - If tears are sought and do not come with prayer alone, experiment with a guided somatic session (45–60 minutes — body-oriented breathwork or a therapist trained in somatic experiencing) to allow affect to move. This pairs your spiritual seeking with embodied release.

### The Path Forward
You carried a heavy month with honest tenderness — reverence for what you love and an honest appraisal of how suffering can isolate. There is already useful material here: you know your triggers, you have trusted consolations (music, poetry, walking), and you can name the patterns that trap you. The next step is to convert insight into small experiments that preserve what you value (restraint, faith) while restoring agency and safety. Start with a safety plan plus one behavioral experiment this month, journal the results, and let each small success loosen the loops that have kept you stuck. You’ve endured much; now let practice and simple structure be the allies that help you feel less wretched and more able to move.
