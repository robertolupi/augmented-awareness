**Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Words used include "wretched" (weather), "congratulate myself," "reconciled," "exclaim," and "beseech" — intensity not numerically specified.  
- Cognitive Distortions: overgeneralization *(inferred)* (e.g., "they spoil everything").  
- Coping Strategies: cognitive reframing/acceptance ("congratulate myself," "become reconciled"); verbal expression of frustration ("exclaim," "beseech").

- Numeric metrics: None observed.

**Recurring Themes & Patterns**
- Persistent bad weather vs. occasional bright sun.  
- Frustration with other people repeatedly "spoiling" blessings.  
- Habitual internal reconciliation during adverse conditions.

**Notable Behaviors or Habits**
- "I never omit to exclaim" on sunny mornings (explicit habitual response).  
- Tendency to reframe adverse external conditions into personal consolation ("congratulate myself," "become reconciled").  
- Repeated moral judgment of others' actions.

**Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
- The author is aware of their own pattern: converting bad weather into a consoling perspective and reacting strongly to others' perceived self‑sabotage; they explicitly note both resignation and active verbal expression.

**Self‑Reflection Questions**
- What does "reconciled" feel like for you in practice when weather or people disappoint you?  
- How might you respond differently to sunny days without defaulting to judgment of others?  
- When you feel compelled to "beseech" others, what outcome are you hoping to achieve?
