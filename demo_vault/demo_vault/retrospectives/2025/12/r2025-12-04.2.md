**Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity – intense despair, anguish, tearfulness, acute emotional distress.
- Cognitive Distortions – all-or-nothing/hopelessness ("It is all over with me"), catastrophizing ("I can support this state no longer").
- Coping Strategies – crying, pacing, withdrawing from the situation, seeking comfort in memory of music.
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion – Charlotte's exhortation to "endeavour to compose yourself" presents an invitation toward self‑regulation; no explicit self‑compassion expressed.

**Physical Health & Sleep**
- Routines – Not specified.
- Numeric metrics verbatim – None observed.

**Recurring Themes & Patterns**
- Mourning past happiness and preferring remembered melodies; music as trigger for intense sorrow; focus on wedding‑ring as symbol of loss; repeated reference to "sorrows and the disappointments" of the past.

**Notable Behaviors or Habits**
- Close attention to others (sitting by Charlotte), fixation on symbolic object (wedding‑ring), strong emotional reactivity to music, pacing, abrupt withdrawal.

**Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition**
- The author recognizes an inability to endure his current state ("I can support this state no longer"), notices music and the ring provoke painful recollection, accepts Charlotte's observation that he is ill, and appeals to God about his torments.

**Self‑Reflection Questions**
- What specific memories does the melody evoke, and how do they connect to current suffering?
- What small, concrete steps could help you "compose" yourself when music triggers overwhelming emotion?
- Who or what could provide support immediately after such an episode?

**Commitments / Action Items**
- Endeavour to compose yourself (Charlotte's exhortation; commitment not specified).
- Remove yourself from the triggering situation when overwhelmed (tore himself away) *(inferred as a future strategy)*.
