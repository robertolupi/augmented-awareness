1. **Key Events**
   * Sat beside Charlotte while she played piano; observed her sister dressing a doll; music triggered intense emotion and tears. (”that divine, air which has so often enchanted me.”)
   * Leaned down, looked intently at Charlotte’s wedding‑ring; tears fell and recollections of the past arose—comforted briefly, then overwhelmed by memories of sorrows and disappointments.
   * Pacing and acute distress followed; heart convulsed with painful emotions.
   * Approached Charlotte and exclaimed to stop the music; she urged him to leave and compose himself. (”For Heaven's sake, play that air no longer!”) (”Werther, you are ill: your dearest food is distasteful to you. But go, I entreat you, and endeavour to compose yourself.”)
