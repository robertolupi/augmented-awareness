### 1. Key Events
The entry describes an intense internal experience: the author is haunted by the persistent image of someone's "dark eyes" appearing whenever their own eyes are closed, absorbing their senses. This is an internal, psychological event rather than an external occurrence.

### 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary
**Mood:** Overwhelmed, consumed, haunted, melancholic, despairing, disillusioned, existential.
**Stress/Burnout markers:** The intense, pervasive nature of the haunting image ("waking or asleep," "fills my entire soul") suggests significant mental burden or preoccupation. The subsequent existential questioning and sense of human limitation point to a heavy, possibly draining, mental state.
**Positive moments:** None mentioned.
**Negative spirals:** The feeling of being completely absorbed and overwhelmed by an internal image; a descent into existential despair about human powerlessness and the monotonous nature of existence, despite aspirations.

### 3. Physical Health & Sleep (if mentioned)
The entry mentions the image haunting the author "waking or asleep," indicating that this preoccupation transcends states of consciousness, but no specific details about sleep quality or physical health are provided.

### 4. Recurring Themes (if linked to other entries)
*   Intense emotional preoccupation or obsession with an individual (potentially related to love, longing, or grief).
*   Existential questioning of human purpose, power, and the limitations of human endeavor.
*   The contrast between human aspirations (grasping at infinity) and the perceived reality of a "cold, monotonous existence."
*   Themes of human frailty, powerlessness, and disillusionment.

### 5. Notable Behaviors
No specific external behaviors are described; the entry focuses entirely on internal states and reflections.

### 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author engages in a deep, philosophical reflection on the human condition, questioning the "boasted demigod" status of man. The insight is a disillusioning realization that human powers often fail at critical moments, and that despite grand aspirations, individuals are ultimately compelled to return to a "cold, monotonous existence," highlighting the inherent limitations and cyclical nature of human experience.
