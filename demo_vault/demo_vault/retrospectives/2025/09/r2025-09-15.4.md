- Main happenings: narrator learns the walnut trees at the parsonage (where he sat with Charlotte) were felled; expresses deep anger and mourning; villagers murmur; narrator blames the vicar's wife and criticizes her motives; steward and current vicar intended to divide the trees; the revenue-office revived an old claim and sold the timber; trees lie on the ground; narrator imagines harsh retribution if sovereign. (Quotes: "It makes me wretched, Wilhelm..." ; "the trees had been felled.")

2. **Emotional/Mental Health Summary**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: wretched, wrathful, indignant; intensity appears high (language like "could, in my wrath, have slain the monster").  
- Cognitive Distortions *(inferred)*: overgeneralization about "men incapable of appreciating" valued things.  
- Coping Strategies: communal mourning (villagers murmuring); hoping social sanction (cessation of presents) will punish the vicar's wife *(inferred)*.  
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion *(inferred)*: awareness of personal sentimentality and value placed on memory; potential to process loss through community response.

- How might I channel this anger into a constructive response within the village?
