# Key Events
- Autumnal reflection: author notes nature turning autumnal and compares self to surroundings. (It is even so!)
- Inquiry & meeting: author made inquiries in Walheim about a peasant boy, then met him and spoke; the boy confessed his story with growing openness. (He called God to witness his intentions were honourable.)
- Peasant’s narrative: boy’s passion intensified after author’s departure; he could “neither eat nor drink nor sleep,” followed the mistress, used violence when she was deaf to his entreaties, and later explained confusedly. (the affair occasioned so much scandal)
- Aftermath: the boy was dismissed, avoided, the mistress hired another servant she may marry, and the informer says the boy is determined not to survive the catastrophe. (he is determined not to survive such a catastrophe)
- Author’s reflection and resolution: author expresses temptation to reserve sorrow, feels calmer after writing and re-reading the tale, and compares his fortune to the boy’s and to Wilhelm’s. (I am tranquil to-day)

# Emotional/Mental Health Summary
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: melancholy and sorrow are described (peasant: “subdued melancholy”; author: troubled but “tranquil to-day” and “not so agitated as usual”).
- Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing present in the peasant’s statement (“determined not to survive such a catastrophe”).
- Coping Strategies: narration/writing (author: employed upon this narration); speaking/confession (peasant telling his story); inquiry (author asked about the boy).
- Growth Opportunities / Self‑compassion: author recognizes tendency to attract and pity the unfortunate and questions sharing sorrow (“Why should I not reserve all my sorrow for myself?”).

# Physical Health & Sleep
- Routines: Not specified for author.
- Reported symptoms (peasant): “He could neither eat nor drink nor sleep.” 
- Numeric metrics: None observed.

# Recurring Themes & Patterns
- Empathy for the unfortunate; attraction to suffering.
- Recurrent sorrow and comparison with others (author references an “old song” he utters eternally and compares himself to Wilhelm and the peasant).
- Writing as a calming/repetitive practice (read and re-read the tale).

# Notable Behaviors or Habits
- Author habitually inquires into others’ misfortunes and writes about them.
- Author re-reads his narratives.
- Peasant initially reserved, then confessed; followed mistress and resorted to violence; later expressed despair.

# Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition
- The author is aware of a persistent attraction to unfortunate people, questions whether to share or reserve personal sorrow, and notes that writing this narration has reduced his agitation. He compares his expected fortune to the peasant’s.

# Self‑Reflection Questions
- What does reserving your sorrow for yourself change about how you relate to others?
- How does writing and re-reading this tale alter your emotional state and perspective?
- In what ways do comparisons to the peasant or to Wilhelm shape your expectations of your future?

# Commitments / Action Items
- The peasant is explicitly determined not to survive the expected catastrophe (stated by informant).
- Continue using narration/writing to reduce agitation *(inferred from “I am tranquil… for I have been employed upon this narration”).*
- Consider reserving personal sorrow rather than soliciting pity *(inferred from rhetorical questioning about reserving sorrow)*.
