1. **Key Events**
   - Main happenings: The narrator learns that the walnut trees at S— (where he sat with Charlotte and venerated the old pastor who planted them) were felled; he reacts with intense anger and sorrow. The schoolmaster informed him (with tears). The vicar’s wife is identified as having ordered the felling for reasons related to leaves, light, noise, and her nerves. Villagers murmur in displeasure. The steward and the new vicar intended to divide the trees; the revenue-office revived an old claim and sold the timber; the logs remain on the ground. The narrator imagines harsh retribution if he were sovereign. (Illustrative quotes: "Yes, cut to the ground!" ; "why they allowed it?" ; "Ah, sir!" ; "when the steward orders, what can we poor peasants do?")
