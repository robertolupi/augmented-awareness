- The author inquired in Walheim about a peasant boy, met him on the road, and listened to his full account.
  - The lad initially replied with subdued melancholy; he confessed passion and misfortune ("subdued melancholy").

  - He insisted his intentions were honorable and wished to marry her ("desired nothing more sincerely than that they should marry").
  - The mistress, urged by her brother, became reserved and dismissed him; scandal prevented his return ("she became reserved toward him").
  - The new servant was hired and is likely to marry; the informant says the dismissed man "is determined not to survive such a catastrophe".
