- Self-questioning and admission of possible self-deception ("I am only deluding myself").

### Reflective Insight or Meta‑Cognition

### Self‑Reflection Questions
- What would being near Charlotte provide that makes it preferable to other plans?
- How might you test whether your belief that you're "deluding" yourself is accurate?
- If you follow your heart, what practical steps will ensure that choice aligns with long‑term goals? *(inferred)*
