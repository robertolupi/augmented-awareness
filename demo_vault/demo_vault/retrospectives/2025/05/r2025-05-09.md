- Reflected on ancestors, poetry, and Ulysses; concluded man needs little earth for enjoyment.
- Staying with the prince at his hunting lodge; finds the prince honest and unaffected but uneasy about some companions (illustrative quote: “He values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart.”).
