1. **Key Events**
- Afternoon at the Count of O—'s house: dined with the Count; walked and conversed with him and Colonel B— as the evening assembly approached. (No direct quote for this action.)  
- Arrival of the Lady, her husband, and daughter; they passed him with disdain, prompting his decision to leave but he stayed when Miss B— arrived and he spoke with her, then noticed she became confused. (He exclaimed inwardly: "Heavens!")  
- The assembled company began to murmur; the Count took him aside and told him the company was displeased at his being there. (Count: "You know our ridiculous customs.")  
- He apologized to the Count and immediately left the assembly, rode to M—, watched the sunset, and read Homer (a soothing episode). (He said to the Count: "I beg your excellency's pardon!")  
- Evening at home: few people at supper playing dice; A— observed the earlier incident to him. He initially minimized it, then realized it was widely spoken of and felt embittered and pitied. (A—: "You have met with a disagreeable adventure."; his own minimizer: "Deuce take the assembly!")  
- Author reflects on being pitied and mocked, expresses intense distress at being laughed at by fools and enemies. (Extreme expression: "I could plunge a dagger into my bosom.")
