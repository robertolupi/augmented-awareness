2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

*   **Stress/Burnout markers:** Expresses a profound inability to function effectively ("I am unable to do anything for myself: how, then, should I be competent to assist others?") and a clear statement that "It is necessary I should leave this place."
*   **Positive moments:** The firm decision to follow their own path, the prospect of being "completely my own master" with the Prince, and the freedom of a new environment.

4. Recurring Themes

*   Made a significant, unconsulted decision (tendering resignation).
*   Prioritized personal well-being and desire for self-mastery over established career paths and others' expectations.
*   Acted decisively to change circumstances due to a feeling of personal incapacitation.

*   They demonstrate a clear awareness of the external reactions and consequences of their decision (mother's affliction, others' arguments).
*   Despite this awareness, they assert a powerful, non-negotiable need for change and self-directed action, prioritizing their own state above all else.
