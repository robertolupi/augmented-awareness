6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition
The author recognized that Miss B—'s revelation of the societal condemnation was like "a dagger to my heart" and that it would have been a "mercy" for her to conceal it, indicating an awareness of his own fragile emotional state and vulnerability to external information. He also understood the nature of the condemnation, specifically linking it to his "pride" and "want of esteem for others," although this understanding only fueled his rage rather than leading to a calming insight.
