• Primary Cognitive Distortions: absolute self‑judgment — “I am unable to do anything for myself…” *(inferred in source)*.  
• Coping Strategies: seeking change of environment via patronage; delegating difficult communication (asking recipient to soften news).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: opportunity to practice autonomy by living independently *(inferred)*; prompts: what to gain with the Prince, how to explain to mother, what increases future competence.
