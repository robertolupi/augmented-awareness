# r2025-W04

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Sheltered in an inn during a storm, the entry records a warm social moment with Miss B— and continued correspondence with Charlotte as highlights, while persistent emotional numbness, social performativity, and withdrawal are the main stressors. Only one journal entry is provided (2025-01-20); missing days limit pattern certainty.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: melancholic, numb, disenchanted, longing (intense in the single entry).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: overgeneralization/absolute statements *(inferred)*; depersonalization/detachment ("puppet" metaphor) *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: writing to Charlotte, flattering/agreeable social behavior, imagining rural retirement.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes performative emptiness; prompts include small concrete actions toward authentic connection and testing whether rural retirement is avoidance.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: habitual agreeableness/flattery in social settings, avoidance of intended activities (plans to rise/ramble often unfulfilled), staying in bed, and imaginative storytelling offers to children.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood/energy appear consistently low and withdrawn on the recorded day; missing other days prevents detecting an intra‑week trend.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep/activity: irregular routines and frequent staying in bed. Numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Repeated avoidant behavior: unkept plans (sunrise, ramble), staying in bed despite intentions, and using imagination/letters as partial escape *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No tasks completed (0/0). Stated/recorded actions: wrote a letter from the inn (acted), offered domestic plans with Miss B— (discussed), resolved to return to his room (intended).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Persistent solitude and emotional numbness coexisting with performances of sociability. 2) Yearning for authentic domestic connection (Charlotte/Miss B—) framed as both hope and potential escape *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Continue correspondence with Charlotte — acted (letter written).  
- Return to room/dungeon at the inn — stated intention; follow‑through not specified.  
- Consider rural retirement with Miss B— — discussed; no concrete action recorded.
