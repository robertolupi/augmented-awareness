1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week was marked by profound emotional distress, beginning with overwhelming despair, anhedonia, self-blame, and suicidal ideation. This intense internal suffering later transitioned into a state of powerful, potentially obsessive, emotional infatuation that felt equally overwhelming and draining. A significant stressor was the perceived loss of joy and vitality, compounded by a struggle with self-control, particularly evidenced by increased wine consumption. Charlotte's "tenderness and goodness" provided a fleeting highlight amidst the turmoil, even as the intensity of feelings for her became a new source of emotional prostration and vulnerability.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The mood trajectory shifted from a deep, numb despair and wretchedness at the beginning of the week to an intense, consuming, and somewhat surrendered emotional state towards the end. While both periods reflect significant distress, the energy evolved from a sense of internal "withering" and emotional numbness to an overwhelming, "prostrated" energy driven by powerful, infatuated feelings.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mentally, the week saw a consistent struggle with severe anguish, transitioning from existential despair and anhedonia (marked by a desire not to awaken) to intense emotional vulnerability and the burden of obsessive feelings. Physically, there were initial suggestions of the body manifesting emotional exhaustion, which later progressed to a concerning pattern of increased wine consumption, indicating a reliance on external substances as a coping mechanism for emotional distress.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
Compulsive behaviors included wishing for death, ritualistic pleading for tears, and a notable increase in wine consumption. There was also an intense, possibly unchecked, expression of feelings towards Charlotte despite her apparent discomfort. Ruminating on past happiness might serve as an emotional avoidance of the painful present.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The author engaged in active spiritual appeal, bending a knee to implore God for tears, reflecting a deep desire for emotional release. A significant action was the direct and intense expression of profound feelings for Charlotte. There was also a reflective insight regarding the inefficacy of "importunate entreaties" for divine blessings, suggesting a nuanced understanding of spiritual connection.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The week's narrative is dominated by a profound and volatile emotional experience, oscillating between deep, existential despair and intense, all-consuming relational infatuation. Recurring themes include a persistent struggle with self-control, the search for solace (whether through spiritual means, emotional release, or substances), the overwhelming impact of external relationships, and a poignant longing for a lost state of inner peace and joy. There's a strong undercurrent of self-awareness regarding emotional vulnerability and a perceived lack of control over one's own feelings and behaviors.
