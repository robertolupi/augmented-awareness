# r2025-W45

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two entries show sustained inner suffering: intense despair and self‑reproach early in the week (Nov 3) and later emotional depletion paired with increased wine use and relational dependence (Nov 8). Key positives are prayer, memory of past gratitude, and tender external concern from Charlotte; major stressors are persistent hopelessness, rumination, and rising alcohol use.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: deep despair/wretchedness (Nov 3); low energy/prostration (Nov 8).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑blame, overgeneralization, hopeless absolutes.  
• Coping Strategies: kneeling/prayer; rumination; increased wine consumption (Nov 8).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recalls past patience/gratitude as a resource; prompts to identify actionable, small steps toward emotional release.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent rumination and morning reflection in nature (Nov 3); repeated kneeling/prayer. Newer/heightened habit: drinking more wine (Nov 8). Revisiting emotionally charged locations (sitting where Charlotte descended).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Starts in acute despair and emotional numbness, then shifts to low energy with relational surrender and substance‑use coping later in the week.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: not specified. Physical activity: observing nature, lying in bed noted (no metrics). Weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Evidence of avoidance: rumination and drinking appear to replace active problem‑solving; no tasks completed across entries (✓0/0).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks recorded. Actions taken: repeated prayer/kneeling (Nov 3) and increased wine consumption plus revisiting a memory spot (Nov 8). No major decisions documented.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: internalized self‑blame and emotional deadness persists. Emerging thread: relational influence and alcohol use as an emotional regulator, undermining energy and agency *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated/observed: continue kneeling/imploring God for tears — acted upon (observed). Consider addressing wine consumption in response to Charlotte’s reproval — noted in reflection but no clear follow‑through (inferred intent; follow‑through not specified). Revisit past patience/gratitude practices — suggested *(inferred)*, action not shown.
