# r2025-W16

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on a relieved gratitude after receiving a gift of "five and twenty ducats" from the crown prince and an accepted resignation (reluctantly), contrasted with fear of maternal interference and deliberate withholding of correspondence.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: fear of interference → reluctance → deep gratitude (moved to tears).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping Strategies: delayed replies; withheld a letter; accepted external financial support instead of asking mother.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompts present about safety sharing, effects of delaying replies, and setting boundaries.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behavior this period: strategic withholding of communication until outcomes are known, seeking official approval, and opting for external patronage over family requests.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day snapshot shows a shift from anxious/guarded to emotionally moved and relieved; insufficient multi‑day data to describe a weeklong trajectory.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Weight/sleep scores: Not specified. Other numeric metric noted: financial gift quoted as "five and twenty ducats."

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Delaying replies and withholding letters appear as deliberate avoidance tactics to manage potential interference and control timing of disclosures.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Resignation was accepted by the minister; accepted the crown prince’s gift; decision made not to request money from mother; commitment to avoid recounting the minister’s writings to prevent lamentation.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: controlled disclosure (withholding correspondence to manage relationships) and reliance on external patronage reducing immediate financial dependence on family.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: will not request money from mother (acted upon by decision after the gift); will refrain from recounting minister’s writings (intent stated). Task completion: None observed; missing follow‑through on explicit tasks not documented.
