# r2025-W48

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Music, reading, and small acts of charity appear as immediate consolations; major stressors are persistent anguish, yearning coupled with self‑denial, and a sense of unique wretchedness. Encounters (a musical scene, poetry, a distraught man and his mother) amplify both empathy and despair.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: intense sorrow, agitation, longing, and self‑reproach (descriptions: "quite overcome," "wretched," "without joy, without hope").  
• Primary cognitive distortions: overgeneralization / black‑and‑white thinking (stated/annotated in notes) and possible catastrophizing *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: music/piano, reading poetry, walking, prayer, giving alms.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: invite examination of fears behind vows and recognition that poetry/encountered lives share emotional commonality *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent use of arts and movement for regulation: piano/music for immediate relief, reading for understanding, and walking/giving as active coping. Deliberate restraint (vow) is a repeated behavioral response.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood remains downward and restless across entries—initial overwhelmed yearning → deepened wretchedness → agitated sorrow with externalizing empathy and prayer *(inferred continuity across dated entries)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Appetite: reduced at least once (no appetite before river walk). Activity: walking reported; piano playing noted. Numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit task procrastination recorded. Avoidance appears as emotional withdrawal and self‑imposed abstention (the vow) rather than behavioural delays *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions/actions: vowed never to kiss (explicit), read and reflected on poetry, walked and gave money to a distressed mother, voiced a plea for spiritual return/forgiveness. No checklist tasks completed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Art and encounter as transient relief; 2) restraint and self‑condemnation coexisting with yearning and compassionate action.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: the vow of abstention (stated, acted as intention), desire to explore sources of doubt (mentioned as reflection; follow‑through not detailed), repeated appeals for forgiveness/return (expressed verbally). Gaps: no concrete follow‑up actions recorded.
