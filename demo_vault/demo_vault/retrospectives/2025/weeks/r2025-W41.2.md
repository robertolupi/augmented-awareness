# r2025-W41

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two recorded days show vivid romantic joy (pleasure in a beloved’s eyes) and intense literary‑melancholy (immersion in Ossian). Major stressors: concern for Albert’s apparent unhappiness and difficulty articulating complex emotions.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum: joy/romance → grief/concern → melancholy/longing. Intensity: not quantified.  
• Primary cognitive distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping strategies: gaze at the beloved’s eyes as emotional solace *(inferred)*; deep literary immersion provides emotional transport *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: practice clearer expression; check in on Albert.  
• Data gap: only 2 days recorded this week; missing days limit confidence in trends.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: prolonged visual attention to the beloved’s eyes, recurrent literary immersion and imaginative identification with heroic/romantic scenes. No formal routines (meditation, exercise) specified. Tasks recorded as completed: 0/0 (each day).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Across the two entries mood oscillated from tender joy to reflective grief and heroic melancholy; energy/activity levels not specified.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, exercise, weight, and sleep scores: Not specified. No numeric health metrics provided.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination described; absence of completed tasks (0/0) may suggest avoidance of practical tasks *(inferred)* but is not directly stated.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No concrete tasks completed. Notable decisions/stances: a declared aesthetic shift preferring Ossian over Homer; expressed intent to speak more directly about feelings *(inferred intent recorded, not evidenced by follow‑through)*.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Romantic/poetic longing drives both joy and sorrow. 2) Literary immersion functions as primary emotional outlet *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: try to express feelings more directly; observe/check on Albert *(both labeled as inferred commitments in entries)*. Evidence of follow‑through: none recorded.
