# r2025-W21

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The author revealed a concealed ambition to join the army, then accepted the prince’s objections and revised course; this willingness to listen and change is a highlight. Major stressor: the plan failed and was kept secret until after the outcome, creating a personal setback *(inferred)*.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: desire to join the army is stated; specific mood labels/intensity not given. Data are limited because only one day is provided.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None mentioned.  
• Coping Strategies: Kept plan private until outcome; sought counsel by discussing the plan with the prince; accepted external advice.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: Recognizes prudence in listening to the prince; prompts: what would you share earlier vs. later, and how to integrate feedback next time.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors in the entry: secrecy about personal plans, discussing major decisions during a walk with a confidant, and deferring to an experienced advisor. No formal routines (meditation, exercise, Pomodoro) are mentioned.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Only one day is reported; the observable arc moves from ambition/desire toward disappointment and acceptance after advice *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Pattern of withholding plans until success (intentional secrecy) is explicit; there is no explicit evidence of task procrastination. Any link to avoidance of discussion prior to success would be an interpretation *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decision to disclose the failed army plan to the prince and to accept his reasons, thereby revising the course of action. No completed tasks or other accomplishments are listed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: secrecy around ambitions paired with deference to a trusted authority, leading to plan revision; learning through disclosure and counsel.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments/action items: None specified. Follow‑through: the author did act (disclosed the plan and accepted counsel); future commitments are not recorded.
