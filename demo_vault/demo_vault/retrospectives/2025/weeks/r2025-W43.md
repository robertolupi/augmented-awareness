1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The recorded day centers on strong melancholy and existential doubt, balanced by moments of close observation and turning to writing as an outlet.

• Primary Cognitive Distortions: overgeneralization *(inferred)*; catastrophizing/negative forecasting *(inferred)*; assuming others' indifference *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: withdrew from social interaction, attempted reading, engaged in writing.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: no explicit self‑compassion practices noted; writing appears as a potential outlet *(inferred)*.
