# r2025-W02

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on a clear insight: visible rank and ceremony are being overvalued compared with substantive influence. Major stressors were social friction over precedence (sledging‑party) and a pattern of neglecting important work for petty status concerns.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Not specified.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: equating rank/position with real greatness; overvaluing ceremony and precedence.  
• Coping Strategies: none specified; critical observation of others *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: reframe priorities toward cultivating real influence and coordinating others’ strengths; prompt: where to invest time to build substantive impact rather than status.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: devoting long periods to advancing status by small steps, engaging in disputes over precedence at social events, and neglecting important business for petty trifles.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Trajectory cannot be established: only one day of entries and mood/energy are not specified, so no reliable week‑long flow can be drawn.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Physical metrics: Not specified. Mental: recurring preoccupation with hierarchy and ceremony, and irritation when status disputes disrupt group enjoyment.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Evidence of avoidance/procrastination: “neglecting important business for petty trifles” and zero completed tasks reported.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks recorded. No explicit major decisions; reflective conclusion about valuing influence over place is the primary cognitive outcome.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Status‑focused behavior undermines collective enjoyment and distracts from substantive work. 2) A developing narrative that real authority is effectiveness in directing others, not formal place.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated/intended commitments: focus on cultivating real influence; avoid letting precedence disputes spoil group activities — both noted as *(inferred)*. Follow‑through: no tasks completed this period (no evidence of enacted change).
