# r2025-W47

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Conflicted longing and a tender moment (being called "dear") sit alongside self‑destructive imagery (the "poison" metaphor) and repeated rumination; mirth and self‑talk recur as immediate coping. Only two days are provided (2025‑11‑21 and 11‑22), so pattern visibility is limited and missing days constrain trend certainty *(inferred)*.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: conflicted, distressed, moved; intermittent mirth.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing *(inferred)*; mind‑reading *(inferred)* (both noted in the 11‑21 entry).  
• Coping Strategies: repeating phrases to self at bedtime; affecting mirth over troubles.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: moments of self‑awareness (laughing at oneself) are present; prompts to lean into that noticing as a starting point *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent self‑talk/repetition (repeating "dear Werther" "a hundred times"), bedtime rumination, and a practiced affect of mirth in response to trouble; a stated impulse to compose a "litany of antitheses" (set aside time suggested) appears as a potential task.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood shifts from intense, self‑destructive preoccupation (11‑21) toward a conflicted acceptance paired with performative mirth (11‑22).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: bedtime self‑talk noted ("last night, on going to bed"); other sleep metrics: Not specified. Physical activity/weight: Not specified. Numeric verbatim: "a hundred times" (repetition count).

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Using mirth as a response to troubles is explicit; this may function as emotional avoidance rather than resolution *(inferred)*. No completed tasks recorded across entries (0/0).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No tasks completed; recognition/acceptance that the person "belongs to another" (11‑22) is a notable stance. Intention to compose antitheses appears but was not executed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
- Possessive longing versus acceptance.  
- Self‑talk and mirth repeatedly used to manage distress; this both soothes and possibly masks deeper rumination *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
No explicit action items completed. A plan to set aside time for a "litany of antitheses" is mentioned as an intention *(inferred)*; otherwise follow‑through is absent.
