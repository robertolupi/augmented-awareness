1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A tender reunion featuring a playful canary and intimate gestures contrasted with the narrator’s deep melancholy and internal conflict about being emotionally provoked. Major challenge: balancing attraction to her innocence with a conviction that such displays awaken painful longing.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: conflicted, emotionally stirred; love and awakened heart countered by language of life’s “worthlessness.”  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: belief in life’s worthlessness is present in the text.  
• Coping Strategies: averting gaze / turning his face away when provoked.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompts from the entry — What boundary would help preserve equilibrium? How does witnessing innocent joy interact with sense of life’s worth? In what ways might you acknowledge love without losing inner distance?

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
She repeatedly shares physical affection with the bird (feeding from her mouth, offering it to others); narrator shows courteous gesture (kissing her hand) then immediate withdrawal when emotionally stirred.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Snapshot shows an oscillation between tender engagement and melancholic withdrawal within the same encounter.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Avoidance is explicit: the narrator turns away to avoid emotional excitation and to keep inner distance.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No tasks completed. Decisions/choices: he practices physical withdrawal during provocation; he expresses that she “ought not” to excite his imagination, signaling an intent to resist (expressed, partially acted on).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Innocent, tactile intimacy (the canary, shared kisses) surfaces strong romantic longing. 2) Protective withdrawal to maintain emotional distance and stave off perceived meaninglessness *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated/intended: avoid allowing her displays to excite his imagination (“She ought not…”) — follow‑through: turned his face away when provoked (documented). A more explicit boundary plan is not recorded *(inferred gap)*.
