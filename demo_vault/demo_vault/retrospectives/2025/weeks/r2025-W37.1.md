1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week's primary highlight was an initial tender interaction during a visit, including a shared moment with a new canary that initially brought a "delightful sensation." The overwhelming stressor was witnessing an intimate, innocent action involving the canary, which triggered profound emotional distress, a feeling of worthlessness, and existential angst due to intense, unexpressed love.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The mood underwent a significant and rapid negative shift, transitioning from initial tenderness and adoration to profound emotional torment, melancholy, and anguish. The week began with moments of potential positive connection but quickly spiraled into deep internal suffering.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health was severely impacted, characterized by intense emotional pain, existential angst, and feelings of worthlessness. There is a clear indication of significant internal suffering directly triggered by a social interaction. Physical health was not mentioned.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
The narrator exhibited an immediate avoidant behavior by turning away in distress from a situation that caused extreme emotional discomfort. The woman, conversely, displayed open, playful, and intimate affection towards the canary, seemingly unaware of the profound impact her actions had on the narrator.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
A notable action was the narrator's deliberate visit to a significant person after an absence. The reactive decision to turn away, though driven by pain, signifies an attempt to cope or create distance from an overwhelming emotional trigger.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The week is strongly dominated by themes of intense, likely unrequited love, leading to profound emotional pain, existential contemplation, and a deep sense of longing and suffering. A key emerging theme is the heightened torment derived from the perception that the object of affection is aware of the narrator's feelings.
