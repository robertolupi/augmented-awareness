# r2025-W11

1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors
The week has been dominated by profound social humiliation and ostracization. The initial stressor was a public social transgression leading to widespread gossip and condemnation, experienced acutely on Saturday. This escalated dramatically on Sunday with Miss B—'s revelation of the full extent of societal disapproval, her own distress due to the association, and the malicious triumph of perceived "enemies." The pervasive sense of being persecuted and a complete loss of emotional control have been major stressors. The only brief positive moments were fleeting pleasure in conversation with Miss B— and temporary solace found in nature and literature on Saturday.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy
The week began with intense anger and frustration, quickly devolving into deep humiliation, bitterness, and self-pity. This spiraled sharply downward into a state of frantic excitement, extreme fury, profound suffering, and despair on Sunday, marked by a significant lack of emotional containment. The emotional energy, though high, has been overwhelmingly negative and destructive.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)
Mental health has severely deteriorated. The author exhibits extreme emotional volatility, including rage, despair, self-pity, and a pervasive sense of persecution. Crucially, there are explicit mentions and demonstrations of suicidal ideation and actions (repeatedly seizing a dagger, contemplating opening a vein), along with thoughts of violence against others, indicating a significant mental health crisis. Physical health has not been mentioned.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns
**Compulsive:** A pattern of social transgression (deliberately staying where unwelcome), profound emotional outbursts leading to self-harm gestures, and a tendency to externalize blame. There's also a compulsive seeking out of Miss B— despite her altered demeanor.
**Avoidant:** An initial, though temporary, avoidance of social fallout by escaping into nature and literature immediately after a humiliating event.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions
The initial decision to remain at the noble assembly, despite knowing he was unwelcome, was a pivotal, negative action that triggered the week's cascade of events. Confronting Miss B— about her altered manner, while leading to further distress, was a direct, albeit emotionally charged, action to understand his social standing. The repeated act of seizing a dagger and contemplating self-harm highlights a desperate mental state.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)
The most dominant themes are intense social alienation and exclusion, consistently struggling to fit into social hierarchies and facing severe societal judgment. The author's pride and ego, along with an inability to endure humiliation, are central to his suffering. There is a strong, escalating theme of emotional volatility, uncontrollable rage, profound suffering, and despair, including suicidal ideation. Miss B— emerges as a central, yet complicating, figure linked to themes of unrequited or forbidden attachment and heightened societal pressure. A pervasive persecution complex, feeling that "everything conspires against me," is also strongly evident.
