# r2025-W34

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Brief flashes of happiness and clear self‑awareness about the pattern of chasing a "chimera" are the main positives; major challenges are intense nostalgia, rapid mood swings, and intrusive catastrophic imaginings about Albert and places tied to Charlotte.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: fluctuating within the day from brief happiness to deep sinking distress.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
• Coping Strategies: reverie/daydreaming *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: acknowledge the pattern when it starts and ask “what would interrupt the chimera?” as a gentle practice prompt.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Frequent reverie/daydreaming and mentally simulating worst‑case scenarios; physically revisiting meaningful locations and comparing past vs present are recurring behaviors.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood oscillated sharply during the recorded day—from fleeting optimism to pronounced sadness—and missing other days prevents a clearer weekly trajectory *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Mental: prominent rumination, intrusive imagery, and nostalgia‑linked distress.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance episodes described; completed tasks: none (0/0). The focus on reverie and catastrophic simulation may be crowding out task engagement *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No concrete decisions or task completions reported; primary noted accomplishment is meta‑cognitive recognition of the ruinous fantasy pattern.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Rapid internal mood shifts and rumination that amplify distress. 2) Revisiting physical places reliably triggers grief and a sense of loss.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments/action items: None specified. Gap: no behavioral interventions or tasks recorded to counter the chimera.

10. **Summary Tags**
