# r2025-W08

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Conciliatory counsel at work produced a temporary restoration of calm after a sharp conflict with the ambassador; emotionally the author remains deeply distressed by romantic loss and jealousy, choosing to retain a memento rather than bury it. Data missing for 2025-02-18 and 2025-02-19, limiting visibility into midweek shifts.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: irritation/anger → relief/rest (work); intense grief, jealousy, despair about being forgotten (high intensity).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing (fear of “becoming mad” if forgotten); possible personalization/absolutist reactions to criticism *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: accepted external counsel, deferred resignation, kept Charlotte’s picture, wrote letters to friends.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit aim to moderate “youthful ardour” and cultivate less transitory peace of mind; consider small, concrete moderation practices next week.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent tendencies: contradicting the ambassador and acting independently; rapid move from threat to submission when soothed by authority; preserving keepsakes and addressing friends in writing. No structured health or productivity routines specified.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Work conflict produced acute irritation that softened after conciliatory communication, while personal grief and jealousy remained intense and stable across the entries.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Considered immediate resignation but postponed and stayed in post (action taken). Planned ritual burial of papers but ultimately kept the picture instead—suggesting avoidance of letting go *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: accepted minister’s conciliatory letter and delayed resignation; chose to retain Charlotte’s picture and remain socially present in her memory. No task completions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Conflict → reconciliation cycle with authority; 2) persistent attachment to loss and mementos that sustains grief.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Committed to moderate ardour and accept counsel — followed through by not resigning; committed to bury papers/remove picture — did not follow through (kept the picture); committed to maintain social place in Charlotte’s circle — intention stated, action of keeping picture consistent with that intent.
