# r2025-W11

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two episodes of acute social pain: a humiliating assembly that led to withdrawal and reading Homer, then a direct, emotionally catastrophic confrontation with Miss B that escalated to intense despair and suicidal ideation. Major stressor: perceived social condemnation and wounded pride.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: moved from embittered/ashamed (strong) to frantic/despairing with explicit suicidal ideation.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: mind‑reading, personalization, catastrophizing (explicit).  
• Coping Strategies: withdrawal from gatherings, carriage ride, reading Homer, confronting the source of distress, emotional expression (weeping).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: no explicit self‑compassion; consider reframing responses to humiliation *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent pattern of intense social sensitivity: withdrawing from groups when offended; confronting perceived offenders directly; turning to literature for solace; recurrent physical dramatics (seizing a dagger referenced).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood/energy declined over the entries: initial irritation and embitterment progressed rapidly into high arousal, rage, and suicidal despair.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: walking, carriage rides mentioned. Numeric metrics: "a hundred times" referenced. No other metrics specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Withdrew from the assembly (explicit). Withdrawal appears used as immediate escape from social threat; confronting Miss B replaced avoidance with escalation rather than resolution.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: left the assembly; took carriage to M—; confronted Miss B; expressed intent to leave "here" and to send a plain narration to prevent blame. Completed tasks: none listed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Main threads: intense sensitivity to social judgment driving cyclical withdrawal→rumination→escalation; literature as brief refuge but insufficient to stabilize mood.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: leave the locale; send a plain account to avoid blame; seek vindication/retaliation (violent fantasies); continued suicidal impulses. Follow‑through: departure and narration not documented as completed; violent and self‑harm impulses stated but not acted on (status: ongoing/not completed).
