# r2025-W16

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A relief-tinged day: resignation accepted and a generous gift of twenty‑five ducats produced strong gratitude and removed the need to ask the mother for money. Major stressor is ongoing concern about family interference (mother) and awaiting official answers before acting.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: tearful/grateful and relieved around the gift; guarded regarding ministerial correspondence.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping Strategies: delaying replies until official outcomes; withholding distressing details to avoid lamentation.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: consider explicit boundary-setting with mother and rituals to acknowledge the gift and relief *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent tendency to wait for external (court/ministerial) decisions before responding; preference for accepting patronage over requesting family funds; tendency to withhold full narrative to protect recipients.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single reported day: mood moved from anxiety about outcomes/family interference to relief and tearful gratitude after the resignation acceptance and the gift; limited other-day data restricts trend assessment.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep and physical routines: Not specified. Financial metric: twenty‑five ducats received.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Delaying replies until the court’s answer and withholding certain facts are deliberate avoidance strategies that aim to control emotional fallout and timing of responses.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Resignation was formally accepted; decision not to request money from mother (rendered possible by the twenty‑five ducats gift); maintained discretion about minister’s written reluctance.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Waiting for external validation shapes action timing; patronage/gratitude reduces dependence on family and alleviates immediate financial stress.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: will not request mother’s money (followed through by accepting the gift); will not recount the minister’s reluctant wording (acted upon); delaying reply until court answer (acted). Replying now is implied *(inferred)*.
