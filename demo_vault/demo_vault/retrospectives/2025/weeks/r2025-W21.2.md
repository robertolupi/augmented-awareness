# r2025-W21

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week’s entry centers on a secret plan to join the army that was disclosed to a prince during a walk; the prince disapproved and the author accepted his reasons. Strengths: willingness to admit the failed plan and heed counsel; primary stressor: loss of a desired path and its secrecy.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity – Not specified.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions – None mentioned.  
• Coping Strategies – Shared the plan after it failed; accepted the prince’s reasons *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes – Recognizes that ignoring the prince would have been “actual madness”; questions to guide growth: what caused the failure, how sharing feels, and what criteria to use next time.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent pattern of keeping plans private until outcomes are known; discussing major decisions with a trusted authority during walks; tendency to defer to the prince’s judgment.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
With only one entry, the observable shift is from secretive/goal‑oriented intent to acceptance and deference after receiving counsel.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Withholding plans until success and only revealing them after failure is evident; this may reflect avoidance of accountability or vulnerability *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decided to pursue joining the army (plan); disclosed the plan to the prince; accepted the prince’s disapproval and did not pursue the plan. No completed tasks reported.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Secrecy versus disclosure shapes behavior; deference to a trusted authority (the prince) overrides solitary plans and redirects action.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: mention the failed plan — enacted (the plan was disclosed). Stated/inferred: continue weighing the prince’s reasons when making similar decisions *(inferred)*. Pending: answer the self‑reflection questions listed.
