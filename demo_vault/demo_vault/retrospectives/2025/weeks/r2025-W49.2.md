# r2025-W49

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
   The week centers on intense emotional disturbance: unrequited/hidden love, obsessional imagery, and moments of acute despair triggered by music and memory. A contrasting calm narrator (Albert) and repeated inward fixation are the main positives and stressors, respectively.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
   • Mood Spectrum & Intensity: consistently heavy — strongly affected/ impressed (Dec 1), acute despair and hopelessness (Dec 4), persistent obsession and rumination (Dec 6).  
   • Primary Cognitive Distortions: all‑or‑nothing thinking *(inferred)*; catastrophizing *(inferred)*; overgeneralization *(inferred)*.  
   • Coping Strategies: concealment (Wilhelm), calm narration (Albert), crying, pacing, leaving the situation, religious appeal, philosophical rumination.  
   • Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit self‑compassion is absent; there is recognition of suffering and potential for perspective work *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
   Recurrent rumination and visual fixation (image appears when eyes close); music as a reliable trigger; emotional displays (weeping, pacing, outburst); concealment of feelings; calm, measured storytelling as a behavioral contrast.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
   Mood remains low across entries: initial strong impression → acute breakdown at music → continued obsessive preoccupation, with no clear recovery episodes recorded.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
   Sleep, activity levels, sleep scores, weight: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
   Concealment of passion (Wilhelm) is explicit avoidance of emotional expression; leaving the room and rumination appear as avoidance of direct coping or problem‑solving *(inferred)*. Entries available: Dec 1, Dec 4, Dec 6 — other days of the week not provided, which limits detection of broader avoidance patterns.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
   No tasks completed on any recorded day (✓0/0 each entry). Notable decisions/acts: Wilhelm’s concealment leading to dismissal and madness (narrative event), narrator’s abrupt appeal to leave and later to God, Albert’s decision to relate the story calmly.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
   1) Hidden/unrequited love → social fallout and psychological collapse. 2) Persistent rumination/visual obsession amplified by sensory triggers (music), undermining functioning.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
   Explicit commitments: Charlotte urges the narrator to “compose yourself” (Dec 4); no sustained follow‑through recorded. No other future‑oriented actions specified.
