1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Intense romantic longing and jealousy on seeing Charlotte with Albert dominate the day, punctuated by productive emotional self‑soothing (drying tears, composing thoughts) and confiding in Wilhelm. Major stressor: visceral distress at perceived lost or unattainable affection.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: very high emotional intensity—sorrow, longing, jealousy, convulsion on sight of Charlotte.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: counterfactual thinking *(inferred)*; idealization of Charlotte *(inferred)* (both noted in the notes).  
• Coping Strategies: crying, drying tears, composing thoughts, verbalizing feelings to Wilhelm.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: expresses intent not to murmur and asks forgiveness for tears; practices restraint.  
• Data gaps: only one day provided, limiting week‑long trend confidence.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors recorded: confiding in a close friend (Wilhelm), reading/sharing literary passages that heighten emotion, and active self‑soothing after distress. No regular exercise, sleep, or work routines specified.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood swings from acute emotional upheaval to deliberate composure within the same day: intense distress → crying → drying tears → composed reflection.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Mental: acute emotional distress with rapid self‑regulation. Physical/sleep/activity metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance or procrastination reported; the author faces feelings directly by crying and confiding.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Chose to confess and reflect with Wilhelm; resolved not to murmur; executed self‑soothing (dried tears, composed thoughts). No task completions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: acute unrequited longing and idealization of a partner contrasts with intentional self‑restraint and reliance on social support. Secondary: literature as an emotional amplifier.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: not to murmur, to dry tears and compose thoughts, continue confiding in Wilhelm — all acted upon in the recorded entry (follow‑through observed for self‑soothing and confiding). Long‑term adherence: Not specified.
