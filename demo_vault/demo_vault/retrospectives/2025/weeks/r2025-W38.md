# r2025-W38

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week (single recorded day) centers on the painful loss of cherished walnut trees and the narrator’s intense anger and grief; community murmurs and the vicar’s household actions are the primary stressors. No positive accomplishments were reported.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: anger, wrath, wretchedness, grief — described as strong (e.g., "in my wrath, I could have slain the monster...").  
- Primary Cognitive Distortions: None observed.  
- Coping Strategies: verbal venting; soliciting communal disapproval; imagining punitive retribution if in authority.  
- Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: Not specified; forward‑looking prompts present in the entry: "What would help you process this loss without escalating anger?"; "How might you honor the memory of the trees?"; "What responses from the community would feel reparative?"

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent habits: sitting under the walnut trees with Charlotte during parsonage visits; consulting the schoolmaster for local news; expecting villagers to present gifts to the vicar (and using that as a potential sanction). No tasks were completed.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Recorded day shows acute, high‑intensity anger and sorrow; insufficient additional daily data to map a week‑long trajectory.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Physical activity/exercise: Not specified. Numeric metrics (sleep scores, weight): Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance or procrastination reported; rumination and outward venting are the dominant responses.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks or procedural actions. Stated responses: hope that villagers will cease presenting gifts to signal disapproval; monitoring village reactions was noted as an intention *(inferred)*.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Two main threads: deep sentimental attachment to past/nature (the walnut trees) driving intense grief, and a recurring sense of powerlessness and resentment toward authority figures who remove valued communal assets.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Hope villagers will withhold gifts to punish the vicar’s wife — stated but not enacted.  
- Monitor village response — mentioned as an intended follow‑up *(inferred)*.  
- No explicit checklist or procedural commitments completed.
