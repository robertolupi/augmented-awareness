# r2025-W29

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A clear emotional throughline: longing to be near Charlotte drives attention and plans, while an external obligation requires staying two more weeks. Strengths: candid self‑awareness and intention setting; stressor: internal conflict between honest motive and prior rationalizations.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: predominant longing/desire and introspection; intensity notable in wording (explicit).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: self‑deception (explicit); wishful thinking *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: confiding, introspection, “obeying” heart’s impulses.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: name the motive (done); consider practical steps after the fortnight.  
• Missing data: only one daily entry this week — limits visibility into variability.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
No stable routines reported. Recurring behaviors: confiding in a listener, attending to emotional impulses, planning/considering travel. Following emotional impulses appears to inform relocation considerations *(inferred)*.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑entry snapshot: mood centers on persistent longing and inward reflection; energy and fluctuation across days are not specified.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Physical activity: Not specified. Weight/metrics: Not specified. Time obligation noted: remain for two weeks (a fortnight).

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance or procrastination reported; instead there is admission of possible self‑delusion rather than active delay.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: remain for two more weeks (obligatory); plan to visit the mines after the fortnight; intention to be near Charlotte. Tasks completed: 0/0 (explicit).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: emotional desire (to be near Charlotte) shapes plans and self‑narrative. Secondary: tension between stated plans and acknowledged true motives.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: remain for fortnight (committed/obligatory); visit mines after fortnight (intended); seek proximity to Charlotte (intended). Follow‑through: no completed tasks yet; timing constrained by obligation.
