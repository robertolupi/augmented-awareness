# r2025-W45

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two entries show a swing between profound numbness and tender attachment: one day dominated by suicidal ideation, self‑blame, and prayer for tears; another by heightened wine use, low energy, and preoccupation with Charlotte. Major stressors: persistent rumination, alcohol use, and very low energy; a major positive thread is memory of past gratitude and moments of affectionate connection.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: from profound despair and numbness (explicit) to prostration and affectionate yearning (explicit).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: personalization; overgeneralization/all‑or‑nothing; hopeless absolutism (all marked *(inferred)* in the notes).  
• Coping strategies: prayer/physical kneeling, rumination, increased wine consumption (explicit).  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: recall past patient/grateful practices; consider small, concrete steps toward patience (explicit suggestions).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent rumination and window‑watching; kneeling to pray; revisiting meaningful locations (sitting where Charlotte descended); increased wine consumption noted explicitly.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Starts at deep melancholia and numbness (Nov 3), then by Nov 8 shifts to emotionally prostrated but romantically fixated and drinking more — overall low and unstable energy across available days; missing intervening days limit resolution.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep metrics: Not specified. Physical signs: lying in bed with passive suicidal ideation (explicit); “drinking more wine” and “energies...prostrated” (explicit).

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No tasks completed on either entry (explicit: 0/0). Rumination, bed‑bound passivity, and increased alcohol use appear as avoidance strategies *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks. Stated actions: continued prayer/imploring for tears (explicit). Consideration to reduce wine and to recall past practices is present but not documented as enacted *(inferred)*.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Internalized self‑blame and emotional numbness despite awareness of past gratitude. 2) Attachment to Charlotte coinciding with increased alcohol use and depleted energy — a pattern of vulnerability and passivity *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: continue kneeling/prayer for tears (acted upon in report); intend to recall/reinstate patient gratitude and possibly reduce wine (both noted or suggested but no evidence of sustained follow‑through) *(inferred)*.
