# r2025-W46

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week’s snapshot centers on intense existential despair and religious doubt alongside a clear capacity for endurance and reverence for faith; major stressors are fear of annihilation, feeling forsaken, and acute anguish expressed to a confidant.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense despair, anguish, fear, resignation.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing ("inevitable destruction"), overgeneralization (references to "thousands").  
• Coping Strategies: verbalizing to Wilhelm, theological reflection/prayerful language, requesting quiet/solitude.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: acknowledges endurance and asks for protection from derision; forward prompts include exploring what reduces the felt abandonment and how to investigate being "given" to God.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
No daily routines reported; notable behaviors are expressive disclosure to Wilhelm, turning to theological reflection for meaning, and explicitly asking for silence while distressed.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day snapshot: mood anchored in high‑intensity despair and resignation; multi‑day trajectory not determinable due to missing days.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified. Missing additional daily data limits detection of trends across the week.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No task procrastination noted; explicit request for solitude suggests withdrawal from social contact and engagement *(inferred)* rather than task avoidance.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks recorded. Key actions: addressed Wilhelm (asked for quiet/space) and committed to enduring and confronting questions of faith.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Endurance intertwined with religious doubt: reverence for religion coexists with feeling forsaken. 2) Expressive disclosure (confiding in Wilhelm) as primary coping mechanism.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
• Continue to endure — stated and ongoing.  
• Ask Wilhelm for quiet/space — acted (address was made).  
• Confront questions of destiny/faith — stated; no resolution documented.
