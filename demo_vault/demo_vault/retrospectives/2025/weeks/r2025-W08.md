# r2025-W08

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**
- Two clear stressors: a professional conflict with the ambassador that led to a court complaint and gentle reprimand, and an acute personal loss/jealousy around Charlotte and Albert.  
- Key positives: acceptance of conciliatory counsel produced temporary relief; choosing to keep Charlotte’s portrait served as an intentional coping choice.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: fear/distress → relief (brief) → despair/jealousy; intensity described strongly in both entries.  
- Primary Cognitive Distortions: self‑identified "excessive sensibility" and "extreme ideas of duty"; absolutist catastrophic language about being forgotten.  
- Coping Strategies: submitting to conciliatory counsel at work; preserving the portrait as an emotional anchor.  
- Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: advised moderation of youthful ardour; prompt to pursue more enduring peace of mind.  
- Data gaps limit trend certainty: entries on 18–19 Feb are missing, reducing visibility into persistence of coping changes *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**
- Recurring behaviors: vocal opposition to the ambassador and independent action in professional settings; delaying or refraining from immediate decisive acts (withholding resignation; postponing removal of keepsakes).  
- One‑offs: acceptance of reconciliatory letter and explicit decision to retain Charlotte’s portrait.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**
- Early-week agitation gives way to short relief after conciliatory counsel, then shifts toward acute personal sorrow and jealousy by 20 Feb.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**
- Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**
- Postponement appears twice: refraining from immediate resignation after the reprimand; delaying removal of Charlotte’s papers/picture until a decisive moment and ultimately keeping them.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**
- Chose not to resign after receiving conciliatory counsel (result: temporary rest).  
- Chose to keep Charlotte’s portrait despite Albert’s marriage (result: maintained emotional connection).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**
- Duty vs. sensibility: strong personal standards produce conflict in professional life.  
- Attachment to external anchors: keepsakes and memory preservation sustain identity but may prolong grief.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**
- Hold off on resignation — followed through (restored for another week).  
- Moderate ardour as advised — intended, no evidence of sustained change in entries.  
- Remove/bury Charlotte’s papers — intended, but decision reversed and portrait retained (intention not acted upon).
