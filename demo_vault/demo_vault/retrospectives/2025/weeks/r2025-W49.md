# r2025-W49

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A week dominated by unrequited love, intrusive imagery, and sensory triggers (music, a wedding ring) that repeatedly provoke intense sorrow; a calm recounting by Albert stands out as a stabilizing contrast. Major challenge: recurring overwhelming emotional episodes that lead to withdrawal and prayer.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: consistently affected, sorrowful, and preoccupied; Dec 4 shows acute despair.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing explicitly noted (Dec 4); other distortions such as overgeneralization listed in notes *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: tears, pacing, leaving situations, prayer/appeal to God, mental rumination; calm narration by others (Albert) as an external coping model.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: prompts in entries suggest practicing small composure strategies and identifying support; consider rehearsing short grounding steps suggested in reflections.  
• Data gaps: entries present for 2025-12-01, 12-04, 12-06; missing intervening days limit visibility into day-to-day fluctuation *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Persistent rumination and visual fixation; emotional expression through crying and pacing; repeated withdrawal from stressful social moments; occasional prayer or appeal; others narrate events calmly.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Steady background sorrow with a pronounced acute peak in emotional collapse around Dec 4 (music-triggered), then ongoing intrusive preoccupation by Dec 6 *(inferred)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Physical symptom noted: "heart convulsed with painful emotions" (Dec 4). Numeric metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Concealment of passion (Wilhelm) and active withdrawal from situations when overwhelmed (tore oneself away) are recurring avoidance responses.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No task completions recorded; actions taken include removing oneself from triggers and vocalizing an appeal to God. No concrete, sustained behavioral changes documented.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: unrequited love and obsession repeatedly trigger acute emotional crises. Secondary thread: sensory reminders (music, ring, imagery) reliably precipitate withdrawal while calm narration by others provides a contrasting perspective.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: "endeavour to compose yourself" (Charlotte’s admonition) and appeals for relief; the journal shows immediate attempts to leave and pray but no sustained follow‑through documented *(inferred)*. Missing days reduce confirmation of consistency *(inferred)*.
