# r2025-W36

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A week of intense attachment and melancholy punctuated by small acts of agency: writing/narration that soothes and the practical decision to replace a sentimental coat. Major stressors: jealousy/possessiveness, social friction after reading a private letter, and recurring resignation.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: intense love/jealousy (2025-09-03), subdued melancholy and tranquillity (2025-09-04), amused/imaginative (2025-09-05), regret/nostalgia (2025-09-06).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: self‑comparison / self‑minimization *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: writing and rereading narratives, enquiring/listening, imagination, ordering replacement clothing.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: acknowledge narration’s calming role and explore boundaries around privacy and attachment.  
• Data coverage: entries cover 2025-09-03–2025-09-06; other week days are missing, limiting detection of longer trends.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors: using narration/writing and rereading to process emotion; making local inquiries and listening to others’ stories; reading others’ letters and indulging imaginative scenarios; addressing loss by ordering matching replacement clothes.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moved from consuming longing and jealousy → quieter, reflective tranquility → playful imagination → nostalgic regret over time.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and sleep scores: Not specified. No physical health metrics reported.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination recorded. Possible pattern of immersing in stories/imagination instead of direct confrontation of relationship issues *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions/actions: pursued inquiry and empathetic listening with the peasant; continued writing and rereading the tale (reported calming effect); read Charlotte’s letter (caused social friction); ordered a new coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons. No task completions recorded (✓0/0 each entry).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Possessive longing and sentimentality tied to objects and relationships. 2) Writing/narration functions as an emotional regulator and coping tool — it soothes but may also serve as a way to avoid direct interpersonal work *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: continue refining the peasant’s narration (acted on: rereading/writing continued); replace clothing (acted on: orders placed). Other commitments: none specified; no checklist completions logged.
