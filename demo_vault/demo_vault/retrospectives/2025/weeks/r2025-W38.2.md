# r2025-W38

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week (only one day recorded) centers on the recent felling of cherished walnut trees: a deep, palpable mourning and anger directed at the vicar’s wife, steward, and the revenue office; villagers share the narrator’s grief but feel powerless.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: wretched, wrathful, indignant — high intensity.  
• Primary cognitive distortions: overgeneralization about “men incapable of appreciating” valued things *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: communal murmuring and leaning on social sanction as consolation *(inferred)*.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: awareness of sentimental attachment to memorials; potential to process loss through community response *(inferred)*.  
Note: only one day available, limiting week‑long emotional trend detection.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
No regular routines or health habits reported. Notable behaviors: vivid emotive narration, idealization of the past, public blaming of specific people, and imagining retribution.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Dominantly intense grief and anger on the recorded day; insufficient data to show change across the rest of the week.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity/exercise: Not specified. Numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No avoidance or procrastination episodes reported; focus is on grievance and moral judgment.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No tasks completed and no concrete decisions recorded by the narrator; actions are primarily emotional responses and social discourse.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Sentimental attachment to landscape as a vessel of memory and moral worth. 2) Powerlessness versus local authority — loss fuels moral outrage.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
No commitments or action items stated; intention to punish socially (cessation of presents) is mentioned as a hoped consequence *(inferred)* but not enacted.
