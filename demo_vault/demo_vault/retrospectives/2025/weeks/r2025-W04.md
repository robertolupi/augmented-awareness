# r2025-W04

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Sheltered from a severe storm and briefly connected with Miss B— (rich companionship and shared imaginings); persistent melancholy, emotional numbness, and repeated inaction are the major stressors. The week’s solace is imaginative intimacy; the challenge is lived disengagement.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: Persistent melancholy, longing, disenchantment; intensity strong (single‑day snapshot).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None named explicitly; *(inferred)* overgeneralization and emotional reasoning.  
• Coping Strategies: Seeking solitude, letter writing, social agreeableness/flattery, imagining rural retirement with Miss B—.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: Prompts given in the journal (restore the lost “leaven,” address why small plans fail, distinguish Miss B— from Charlotte).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: habitual agreeableness/flattery, confiding via letters, imaginative storytelling/retirement planning, making plans to rise or ramble that are not followed.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Only one day of data: mood and energy appear low and flat with strong melancholy and intermittent social engagement; no multi‑day trajectory available.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep and numeric metrics: Not specified. Noted behavioral trend: irregular motivation for activity and trouble following through on planned rambles/sunrises.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Repeatedly plans to rise or ramble are not enacted; withdrawal from contact (shudder at touch) and retreat into solitude—patterns of avoidance are evident.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Took shelter during the storm, engaged with Miss B—, and wrote to Charlotte (current letter). Journal lists “None observed” for completed tasks; ✓0/0 tasks completed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Longing for authentic connection vs. performative sociality. 2) Imagined escape and storytelling as refuge while daily inertia persists *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Continue writing to Charlotte — acted (current letter).  
- Maintain imaginative planning with Miss B— — ongoing/acted.  
- Tell children a goblin story if needed — future intention.  
- Rise/rambles — repeatedly not followed (gap between intention and action).
