# r2025-W29

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on a clear emotional pull toward Charlotte and a decision to remain where they are for another fortnight; strengths are self-awareness and articulated intentions, while the major stressor is the tension between obligation and desire.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: longing and ambivalence (explicit).  
• Primary cognitive distortion: self‑delusion ("I am only deluding myself").  
• Coping strategies: smiling at heart's suggestions and obeying emotional impulses.  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: explore what being near Charlotte provides; test the accuracy of the belief you're deluding yourself; "If you follow your heart, what practical steps will ensure alignment with long‑term goals?" *(inferred, as noted in the journal)*

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent tendency to follow emotional impulses and to verbalize plans (stay a fortnight, then consider visiting the mines); no routine health or productivity habits specified.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood stayed dominated by longing and ambivalence rather than showing clear improvement or deterioration across entries.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit avoidance or procrastination recorded; possible postponement of decision‑driven movement *(inferred)* due to choosing to stay.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: remain for a fortnight; consider visiting the mines afterward; intention to be near Charlotte. Accomplishments: none recorded (✓0/0 tasks completed).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: emotional motives (longing for Charlotte) conflicting with planned obligations; clear self‑awareness of potential self‑deception coexisting with a pattern of obeying desire.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: continue here for a fortnight; plan a mines visit; move/seek proximity to Charlotte. Follow‑through: intentions stated but no completed actions recorded this week.
