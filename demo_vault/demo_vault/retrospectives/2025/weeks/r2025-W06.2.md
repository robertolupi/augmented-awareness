# r2025-W06

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week (single entry) centers on a deliberate reframing of bad weather as a personal blessing and a parallel, strong irritation with others who "waste" good conditions. Major stressor: recurrent moralizing frustration toward others; main positive: arriving at reconciliation/acceptance.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: resigned/reconciled with underlying frustration and criticality (intensity not specified).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: labeling/overgeneralization of others as "folly, ignorance, or imbecility" (explicit).  
• Coping Strategies: cognitive reframing of weather as blessing; verbal expression of displeasure.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes reconciliation as achievement; prompts offered about communicating frustration and noticing reconciliation vs condemnation.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent habits in this entry: reframing adversity into consolation, vocalizing exclamations about others' behavior, and a tendency to beseech or admonish (imagined or verbal). No routine productivity practices are reported.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single-day snapshot: mood sits between resignation and irritation; energy/engagement trajectory across the week is indeterminate due to missing days.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No tasks completed are recorded for the entry; this may reflect avoidance or low task engagement in that period *(inferred)*. No explicit procrastination strategy described.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decision: consciously reframe bad weather as blessing (explicit). Accomplishment: self‑reported reconciliation/acceptance. No tasks completed and no action items recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: adaptive reframing as a resilience strategy; persistent moral irritation toward others that undermines full acceptance.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
No commitments or action items specified; intentions about communicating frustration and noticing internal patterns were posed as questions but not recorded as followed up.
