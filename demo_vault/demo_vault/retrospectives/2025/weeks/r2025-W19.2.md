# r2025-W19

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Visited the native village to reconnect with childhood places and memories, finding moments of solace (sitting under the elm, staying at a congenial lodge). Major stressors were recurrent sorrow and a sense of disappointed hopes tied to family loss and change.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: predominant nostalgia, melancholy, heaviness, occasional pride in the heart.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: a noted overgeneralization in one entry ("all the knowledge I possess...") *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: solitary walking, deliberate revisiting of meaningful sites, staying with a supportive companion (prince) — using place and companionship to process feeling *(inferred where implied)*.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: expresses intent to pursue a "future career" and to report back (forward‑looking), suggesting openness to change *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent ritual of returning to childhood locations (re‑entry through a specific gate planned; sitting beneath the elm), solitary reflective walks, descriptive memory work; travel by carriage followed by on‑foot exploration.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moves from intentional nostalgia and reflective curiosity (plan to revisit) into deepened melancholy and heaviness during the visit, with brief relief from congenial company.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified.  
Physical activity: walked from carriage, followed a stream, traveled to and within the village.  
Numeric metrics: "six miles" (distance of native place). Other metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit procrastination described; both entries report zero completed tasks (✓0/0) — this absence of task completion may reflect avoidance or simply lack of listed tasks *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decided to leave the current place and visit the native village; enacted the visit and on‑site reflection; arranged/stayed with the prince at a hunting lodge; committed to inform a friend about a future career (not yet reported as done).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Returning to place as a means of emotional reckoning. 2) Memory and the "heart" contrasted with disappointed worldly hopes.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Planned leaving and village visit — followed through. Re‑entering through the same gate — planned (follow‑through not specified). Promise to inform friend about career — no follow‑up observed.
