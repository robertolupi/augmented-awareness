# r2025-W24

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on a clear creative high — drawings described as the best since arrival — paired with significant interpersonal friction and dissatisfaction with current residence. Major stressors are the prince’s technical interference and the decision to leave soon.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: unease, impatience, dissatisfaction (intensity not specified).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: overgeneralization — “nothing in common between us.” *(inferred)*  
• Coping Strategies: planning travel; prioritizing drawing/art practice.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognition of artistic strengths and intent to remove oneself from an ill‑fitting situation to protect creativity. *(inferred)*

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent drawing/art practice; pattern of planning travel as a solution to interpersonal discomfort; quick impatience when given technical critiques.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day snapshot shows creative satisfaction alongside rising interpersonal frustration; no multi‑day trajectory available due to missing entries.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: regular drawing noted. Numeric sleep/activity metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Tendency to use relocation/travel as the primary strategy to resolve discomfort rather than negotiating in‑place boundaries.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decision to remain one more week, then resume travels; artistic accomplishment: drawings judged the best since arrival. Tasks completed: none listed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Creative work is central to well‑being and a source of resilience. 2) Environmental mismatch (host/prince) undermines creative ease and prompts escape planning.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Commitment: stay one more week, then travel — stated, follow‑through pending. Commitment: continue producing drawings — acted on (drawing practice reported). Missing days limit confirmation of execution.
