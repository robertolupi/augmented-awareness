# r2025-W44

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Two focal positives: intense affection and deep introspection about relational limits. Main stressors: persistent torment from unacted impulses and a sense that possessions are meaningless without the beloved.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense longing, vexation, torment, and affection across entries.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
• Coping Strategies: None specified.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: explicit recognition that one cannot make others share feelings; questions about valuing possessions independently and soothing current vexation were raised.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Persistent inward reflection and rumination; repeated mental approach to physical closeness without acting ("one hundred times" / near‑embrace). No exercise, meditation, or structured routines noted.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood remained consistently intense and conflicted across the week—oscillating between affectionate warmth and torment from restraint.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified. Multiple days of the week are missing (only Oct 27 and Oct 30 provided), limiting trend detection *(inferred)*.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Clear pattern of inhibition: repeatedly withholding action despite strong impulse (habit of approaching mentally but not completing the act), which coexists with sustained rumination.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No tasks completed (✓0/0 reported); no formal commitments or action items. A recurring choice to restrain from physical expression appears as the primary enacted decision.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: intense romantic longing + consistent self‑restraint producing emotional torment. Secondary thread: possession and self‑worth tied to another person, coupled with dawning acceptance of limits of influence.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments/action items: None specified. Follow‑through: none; patterns emphasize hesitation over initiating change.
