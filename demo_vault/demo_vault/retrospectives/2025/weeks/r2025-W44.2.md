# r2025-W44

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week is dominated by intense romantic longing and repeated self‑restraint, alongside clear introspective insight that others’ feelings can’t be controlled. Entries are only from 2025‑10‑27 and 2025‑10‑30; these gaps reduce confidence in broader weekly trends.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
- Mood Spectrum & Intensity: vexation, intense love, emptiness, longing, torment (across entries).  
- Primary Cognitive Distortions: None specified.  
- Coping Strategies: expressive reflection/prose (stated); reflective writing/thinking *(inferred)*; intellectualizing via metaphor (stated).  
- Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: recognizes limits of influencing others (stated); instinct vs restraint noted—suggests opening for self‑inquiry *(inferred)*; prompts to preserve personal wholeness (stated).

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent patterns: repeated approach‑and‑restraint around the beloved, intense rumination about reciprocity and attachment, and expressive reflective writing; no routine work or health rituals specified.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
One‑sentence flow: persistent high‑intensity longing and vexation with ongoing rumination and no clear emotional recovery between the two entries (data gaps limit confidence).

Sleep, exercise, weight, and numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks or conventional accomplishments; deliberate repeated choice to restrain physical action (stated). Tasks: 0/0 completed (stated).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**

- Deep rumination and realization about emotional limits: self‑awareness emerging but not yet translated into action.
