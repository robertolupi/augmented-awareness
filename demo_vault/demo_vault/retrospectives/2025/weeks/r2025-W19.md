1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Returned to the native village and deliberately revisited childhood sites, gaining vivid memories and some solace; primary stressors were persistent melancholy, disappointment with worldly changes, and reflections on family loss.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum: anticipatory nostalgia (5/05) → deepened melancholy, sorrow, heaviness (5/09).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: Not specified.  
• Coping strategies: solitary walks, intentional memory work, lodging with a trusted patron (the prince).  
• Growth & self‑compassion prompts: attend to the heart’s needs and name which parts of the “heart” to preserve.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent pattern of solitary, pilgrimage‑style visits to meaningful sites and reflective walking; writing/communicating intentions to a confidant; lodging with a patron during travel.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moved from reflective/hopeful anticipation to intensified nostalgia and sorrow; activity during the visit involved extended solitary walking *(inferred: increased physical engagement on return day)*.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep metrics: Not specified. Physical activity: repeated long walks and visits to landmarks (explicit). Other numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No completed tasks recorded on either entry (✓0/0 tasks completed); this lack of recorded task completion may reflect avoidance or deprioritizing tasks in favor of recollection *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decided to leave and visit the native place (stated 5/05) and carried out that visit, including sitting under the elm, walking old routes, and lodging with the prince (described 5/09). No other task completions noted.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: returning to origins as a means to process grief and regain grounding. Secondary: the heart’s singular value over external recognition (talent vs. inner feeling).

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated: leave tomorrow; visit native place and enter through same gate; recall childhood memories; inform friend about future career. Follow‑through: travel and revisiting occurred (explicit). Informing the friend about career: Not specified.
