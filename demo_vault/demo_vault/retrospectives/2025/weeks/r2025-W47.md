# r2025-W47

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Moments of tenderness (being called "dear") and self‑awareness (laughing at his own rumination) stand out; primary stressors are intense longing, repeated nighttime rumination, and fear of emotional harm. Only two days (2025‑11‑21 and 2025‑11‑22) are provided; the rest of the week is missing, which limits pattern clarity.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood spectrum & intensity: deep anguish and longing (11‑21) shifting to ambivalence and affected mirth (11‑22).  
• Primary cognitive distortions: catastrophizing ("preparing a poison") *(inferred)*; mind‑reading/attributing intent *(inferred)*.  
• Coping strategies: verbal self‑dialogue, repeating the phrase aloud ("a hundred times"), affected mirth.  
• Growth & self‑compassion notes: notices and laughs at his behavior — an opening for self‑compassion *(inferred)*; prompts: notice ruminative triggers, practice soothing alternatives.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent bedtime rumination and aloud self‑talk; repetition of a meaningful phrase; use of ironic/affected mirth as an emotional response; deliberate restraint from praying to possess someone.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood moves from intense yearning and rumination into a more ambivalent, ironic stance (mirth) by the next entry; energy levels are not specified.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep routines: went to bed and engaged in self‑talk; repeated the phrase "a hundred times." Other metrics (sleep quality, activity, weight) — Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No explicit task procrastination reported (tasks completed: 0/0). Use of mirth as a coping style may function as emotional avoidance *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
No completed tasks (0/0). Notable intentional choices: restraining desires (refusing to pray for possession) and cultivating self‑awareness by noticing and laughing at rumination.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary thread: intense romantic rumination and fear of harm. Counter‑thread: deliberate restraint and ironic mirth as regulatory moves.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
No explicit commitments or action items recorded; no tasks completed. Missing days reduce visibility on follow‑through.
