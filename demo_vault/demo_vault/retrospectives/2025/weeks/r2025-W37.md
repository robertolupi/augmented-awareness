1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A single documented encounter: reunion and intimate small gestures (hand‑kiss, a canary presented as a gift) contrasted with the narrator’s acute melancholy and feelings of worthlessness. Major stressor: inner conflict provoked by her innocent, provocative behavior.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: stirred between love/longing, agitation, and melancholic existential thought.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: globalizing negative belief ("dreams of the worthlessness of life"); prescriptive/ought statement about her behavior ("She ought not to excite my imagination").  
• Coping Strategies: turning his face away (avoidance).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes (forward‑looking prompts present in entry): How does her innocence influence your sense of meaning? What do you hope to feel/do differently when your heart is awakened? What boundary or response might help you stay present?

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent motifs in this entry: absence→reunion, small ritualized intimacy (hand‑kiss, feeding the bird), and the narrator’s physical withdrawal (turning away). No task structure or routines reported.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑day snapshot: intense emotional activation during reunion—love and longing surface quickly and are met by deep melancholy and withdrawal within the same interaction.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, activity, weight, and numeric metrics: Not specified. Only one day provided; broader trend analysis is not possible *(inferred)*.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Reported avoidance: narrator averts gaze/turns face away when emotionally stirred. No explicit procrastination episodes mentioned.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Actions recorded: she went to meet Albert; the narrator visited her; she presented a canary and fed it between people. No completed tasks or formal accomplishments listed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Intimacy rituals (pet, touch) reliably provoke intense inner conflict in the narrator. 2) Presence/absence dynamics amplify longing and melancholy.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
No commitments or action items specified. Self‑reflection questions are present but no stated follow‑through or plans.
