# r2025-W11

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
A sequence of social encounters centered on Miss B— and the Count left the author feeling publicly shamed, embittered, and increasingly agitated; small consolations (driving to a hill, reading Homer) punctuated intense rumination and self‑harm imagery.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: sadness, annoyance → deep humiliation, fury, despair; acute agitation and repeated suicidal ideation on 03‑16.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: mind‑reading, personalization, catastrophizing, overgeneralization.  
• Coping Strategies: leaving the assembly, physical movement (driving), reading literature; few adaptive strategies noted on 03‑16.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: consider rehearsing self‑soothing responses before social situations; practice naming thoughts vs facts when feeling blamed *(inferred)*.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistently attends noble assemblies, immediately withdraws when distressed, ruminates about reputation, seeks literary consolation (Homer), and directly confronts key others (Miss B—).

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood/energy moved from irritation and wounded pride (03‑15) to intensified despair, frantic emotion, and explicit self‑harm ideation (03‑16).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep: Not specified. Activity: walking in halls, driving to a hill, attending dinner; weight/sleep scores: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Notable avoidance: leaving the assembly to escape ridicule and social scrutiny; composing a plain narration to forestall blame (preemptive social management rather than open discussion).

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: apologized to the Count and departed (acted); drove to M— and read Homer (acted); resolved to provide a plain narration of events (stated/composed); confronted Miss B— in private (acted). Tasks completed: none listed.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Primary threads: sensitivity to social judgment and wounded pride recurring across entries; intense impulsive/ruminative responses that lead to withdrawal and self‑harm imagery *(inferred)*.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated commitments: leave distressing settings (followed); send/plainly narrate events to avoid blame (intended and initiated on 03‑15); no new adaptive strategies or follow‑throughs recorded on 03‑16.
