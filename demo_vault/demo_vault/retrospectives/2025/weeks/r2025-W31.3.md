# r2025-W31

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Intense, acute grief and jealous longing around Charlotte’s marriage contrasted with moments of literary consolation and deliberate self‑restraint. No task or productivity highlights; emotional turmoil and a disruptive visit were the major stressors. Missing other days limits pattern confidence.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: intense longing, jealousy, convulsing grief and tearfulness (high intensity).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: counterfactual thinking; assumed knowledge about Charlotte’s happiness.  
• Coping Strategies: crying then drying tears; composing thoughts; reading literature to feel connected; confiding in Wilhelm.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: actively choosing restraint and self‑forgiveness; prompts to practice acceptance.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Literature used as emotional bridge, confiding in a close friend, visible pattern of rumination and vivid imagination, and deliberate suppression of outward complaint after internal expression.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Emotionally peaked with acute jealousy/grief during the entry; no later entries to show recovery or decline (limited data).

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Sleep, exercise, weight, and numeric health metrics: Not specified.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Suppression of outward complaint and emotional restraint—appears as adaptive control rather than task avoidance; no explicit work‑related procrastination noted. Any avoidance of confronting Charlotte directly is *(inferred)*.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions to dry tears, compose oneself, write/confide to Wilhelm, and refrain from murmuring—these emotional self‑regulation actions were enacted. No task completions or career actions recorded.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
Unrequited love and jealous grief paired with literary consolation; intentional self‑restraint amid intense inner turmoil.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated intentions: refrain from outward complaint (acted upon), practice self‑forgiveness (initiated), dry tears and compose thoughts (acted). Continue confiding in Wilhelm listed as an ongoing plan *(inferred)*. Missing days make adherence beyond this entry unclear.
