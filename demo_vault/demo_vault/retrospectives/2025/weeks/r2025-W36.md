1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
The week centers on intense interpersonal attachments (romantic jealousy, nostalgia for a danced-in coat) and repeated encounters with others’ suffering (the peasant’s catastrophe). Writing and inquiry recur as stabilizing activities; social friction (Charlotte’s displeasure, intercepted letter) and unresolved longing are the main stressors.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood Spectrum & Intensity: swings from intense jealousy and longing (9/10 tone) to subdued melancholy and calm (“I am tranquil to-day”).  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: catastrophizing (peasant: “determined not to survive such a catastrophe”); possessive absolutism in romantic language.  
• Coping Strategies: narration/writing, inquiry/conversation, imagination, purchasing replacements.  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: reflective questions appear about reserving sorrow, broadening self beyond one attachment, and allowing time to form new associations.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Recurring: writing/narration as a practice, asking about other's stories, using imagination, and attempting to replicate past feelings by buying identical clothing. One‑offs: reading an intercepted letter; conducting a specific inquiry in Walheim.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Mood fluctuated between acute longing/jealousy and reflective melancholy; moments of calm followed active narration or inquiry.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Author: sleep/activity — Not specified. Peasant: “could neither eat nor drink nor sleep” (reported).

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
Withholding/failing to forward a letter and subsequent silence after Charlotte’s displeasure; the peasant’s dismissal and social avoidance after scandal are reported.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Decisions: investigated the peasant’s story, read the intercepted letter, parted with and replaced sentimental clothing. Accomplishments: narration that produced calm; no discrete task completions recorded (✓0/0 where noted).

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Intense singular attachment and jealousy vs. recurrent melancholy and empathy for suffering. 2) Writing/narration consistently functions as emotional regulation but material or imaginative substitutes do not restore past feeling.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
Stated/intended: allow time to like replacement garments (stated); peasant’s declared determination regarding his fate (reported). Continued use of narration as a stabilizer is suggested *(inferred)*.
