# r2025-W13

1. **Weekly Narrative: Highlights & Stressors**  
Decisive career shift: tendered resignation and intends to accept the Prince’s invitation to spend spring at his country house. Major stressors: fear of afflicting his mother and pronounced self‑doubt about competence; only one journal entry provided, limiting pattern clarity.

2. **Emotional & Mental Landscape**  
• Mood: decisive and anticipatory about leaving, anxious about mother, self‑undermining statements present.  
• Primary Cognitive Distortions: all‑or‑nothing / discounting self *(inferred)*.  
• Coping Strategies: seeking social buffering (asked recipient to soften news) and patronage (Prince).  
• Growth & Self‑Compassion Notes: requests forgiveness and acknowledges limits; prompts in journal ask how to communicate to mother and set boundaries.

3. **Behavioral Patterns: Habits & Routines**  
Consistent behaviors in this entry: unilateral decisive action (resignation), soliciting an intermediary to manage family reaction, turning to a patron for relocation. Daily routines/scheduled practices: Not specified.

4. **Mood & Energy Trajectory**  
Single‑entry snapshot: mood is firm/decisive with underlying anxiety and low self‑confidence; no multi‑day trend available due to missing days.

5. **Health Trends (Mental & Physical)**  
Physical: Not specified.  
Mental: notable self‑doubt and anticipatory concern present in the entry; broader trend cannot be established with one day.

6. **Avoidance & Procrastination Patterns**  
No avoidance or procrastination reported—action taken (resignation tendered) rather than delay.

7. **Key Decisions & Accomplishments**  
Tendered resignation (completed); requested recipient soften news to his mother (asked); decided to accept/accompany the Prince to his country house (intended); resolved to leave despite expected objections.

8. **Overarching Themes: Recurring & Emerging**  
1) Seeking patronage as a practical escape/solution to career distress. 2) Tension between agency (decisive exit) and vulnerability about harming family emotionally.

9. **Commitments & Follow‑Through**  
- Tender resignation — done.  
- Ask recipient to soften news — done (request made).  
- Accompany Prince for spring — intended, not yet enacted.  
Gaps: subsequent follow‑through and mother’s response are unknown.
