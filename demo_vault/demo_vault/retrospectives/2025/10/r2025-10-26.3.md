# r2025-10-26

1. **Key Events**
- Withdrew to a neighbouring apartment when a friend of Charlotte visited; attempted to read but could not, then wrote. ("Yes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, the existence of any being... of very little consequence.")
- Overheard Charlotte and her guest speaking quietly about town news: one marrying; another very ill with dry cough, thinning face, occasional fits; “N— is very unwell too” and “His limbs begin to swell already.” ("N— is very unwell too.")
- Imagination carried the narrator to the beds of the infirm, envisioning struggles against death and "agonies of pain and horror" while the women spoke with indifference. ("agonies of pain and horror")
- Observed surroundings in the apartment—Charlotte's apparel, Albert's writings, familiar furniture, inkstand—and reflected on personal role in the family, esteem from friends, and how long a void the narrator's death would be felt. ("how long would they feel the void")
- Completed tasks: None observed.
