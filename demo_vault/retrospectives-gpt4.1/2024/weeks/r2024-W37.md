1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors  
This week is dominated by the narrator's emotional farewell to Charlotte and Albert, culminating in a charged and sorrowful evening. The stress of impending separation pervades every moment, with both the anticipation and finality of goodbye being profound sources of pain. Revisiting cherished locations and exchanging heartfelt words elicit a deep sense of loss, while Charlotte's emotional openness and reminiscences further intensify the narrator's anguish.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy  
Mood oscillated between profound sorrow, nostalgia, and acute emotional agony. The narrator struggled to maintain composure in social settings but was overwhelmed by waves of grief and longing in private. There is a notable absence of positive or hopeful energy; instead, the week was marked by exhaustion, restlessness, and sinking despondency as he coped with the reality of parting.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)  
Mental health is characterized by acute distress, with clear markers of anxiety, obsessive thought patterns, and emotional overwhelm. Physical symptoms of emotional suffering—such as breathlessness and agitation—were particularly apparent. The likely sleeplessness and lack of physical calm reflect the toll taken by these intense emotional experiences.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns  
Ruminative and repetitive thinking about loss and separation dominates behavior. The narrator repeatedly seeks out familiar, significant locations for self-soothing or reflection, yet is unable to move beyond the fixation on past interactions and the impossibility of future happiness. Emotional self-control is only partially successful, frequently giving way to overt displays of sorrow.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions  
While there is little in the way of forward movement or resolution, the narrator shows moments of bravery in concealing his intentions for the sake of peace, as well as a willingness to be vulnerable and expressive in the face of overwhelming emotion. The decision to spend a final evening with Charlotte and Albert, and to receive Charlotte’s praise, are standout moments that underscore the week’s emotional intensity.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)  
Heartbreak, grief, and the struggle with attachment are constant themes. Nostalgia and the revisiting of emotionally significant locations persist throughout, as do reflections on memory, mortality, and the endurance of inner pain. Self-awareness is heightened, but characterized more by resignation than by growth or change.
