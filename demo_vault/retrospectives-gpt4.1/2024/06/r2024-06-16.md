- During the ball, a thunderstorm causes panic among the guests, but Charlotte takes charge to distract the company with a playful game.
- The evening concludes with an intimate moment between the author and Charlotte, sharing a meaningful exchange by the window as the storm passes.

## 2. Emotional/Mental Health Summary

**Mood:**
- Overwhelmingly elated, enchanted, and passionate; a sense of emotional absorption and infatuation.
- Swings to brief moments of confusion, jealousy, and emotional overwhelm after learning of Charlotte’s engagement.

**Stress/Burnout markers:**
- Mild agitation and restlessness—author breaks personal vows, is unable to focus on writing or daily resolutions due to preoccupation with Charlotte.
- Experience of intense feelings cause slight confusion and distress when faced with obstacles (such as Albert's existence).

**Positive moments:**
- Deep enjoyment and fascination with Charlotte’s character, grace, and interaction with her family.
- Shared experiences at the ball, especially during dances and games.
- Feelings of happiness and fulfillment in Charlotte’s presence.
- Intimate connection during the storm, mutual emotional understanding.

**Negative spirals:**
- Jolt of jealousy and confusion upon mention of Charlotte’s engagement to Albert.
- A sense of despair and emotional overload following tender interaction.

## 3. Physical Health & Sleep

- No explicit mention of health or sleep.
- Some description of restlessness and impulsivity ("three times on the point of throwing down my pen, of ordering my horse, and riding out").
- Describes sensations of agitation (unable to restrain himself, emotional overwhelm at the end).

## 4. Recurring Themes

- Recurring patterns of emotional intensity and romantic idealization.
- The author’s tendency to become absorbed in strong passions is a previously noted pattern (as often suggested by references to Wilhelm).
- Return to resolution-breaking and lack of self-control, a motif appearing in other entries.
- Perennial contrast between idealized happiness and inevitable confrontation with reality (such as the discovery of Charlotte’s engagement).

## 5. Notable Behaviors

- Impulsivity—breaking resolutions about not riding out; acting on emotional whims.
- Dissociative absorption—becoming lost in daydreams and emotionally disengaging from surroundings (e.g., not hearing music, forgetting company).
- Compulsive focus on Charlotte—unable to keep attention on anything else, even to the neglect of social conventions.
- Jealousy—fixating on Charlotte offering oranges to others, or her connection to Albert.
- Self-disclosure—author is candid about feelings, even when intense or potentially embarrassing.

## 6. Reflective Insight or Meta-Cognition

- Author recognizes his own emotional absorption and acknowledges the futility of trying to describe feelings logically ("a poor historian").
- Notices the contrast between idealization (“an angel! nonsense!”) and the challenge of expressing real emotion.
- Self-aware about emotional extremes; reflects on the meaning of delight and distress, and how moments like storms intensify experiences.
- Hints at the necessity of presence and the value of performing courage for others (as Charlotte did), learning from her resilience and self-control.
