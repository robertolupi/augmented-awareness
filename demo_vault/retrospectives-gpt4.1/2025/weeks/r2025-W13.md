# r2025-W13

1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors  
The week was dominated by a major decision: the author submitted their resignation to the court, a move that carried significant emotional weight. This pivotal event brought both relief and added stress, particularly regarding its anticipated impact on the author's mother and the possible perceptions of others. The unplanned nature of the resignation — made without previous consultation — heightened the sense of impulsiveness and isolation. On the positive side, accepting an invitation to the Prince's country estate introduced a note of hope and the prospect of renewal.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy  
Mood fluctuated from decisive and hopeful to regretful and burdened. Early resolve was tempered by self-doubt and concern for familial disappointment. The anticipation of temporary refuge at the Prince's house slightly alleviated the emotional heaviness, hinting at possible recovery, but overall the week's emotional tone was shadowed by fatigue and guilt.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)  
Mental health concerns were prominent: feelings of inadequacy and emotional exhaustion recurred throughout the week. The author expressed both self-doubt and a sense of being emotionally spent, especially after facing such a significant life change. There were no explicit notes on physical health or sleep, though the emotional turbulence likely impacted general wellbeing.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns  
A marked tendency toward impulsivity emerged, as evidenced by the unilateral decision to resign without seeking advice. Avoidance was also present in the author delegating the difficult task of communicating the resignation to his mother, preferring to buffer her from its full emotional impact. Rumination about the reasons for and against the resignation reflected both circular thinking and mental avoidance of the finality of the act.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions  
Resigning from the court stood out as the week's defining action, carrying with it the acknowledgment of personal limits and a break from past obligations. Accepting an invitation to the Prince's country home was a positive step, representing openness to change and the hope of solace or restoration.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)  
The narrative repeatedly circled around the pressures of familial and societal expectations, the burden of emotional responsibility, transitions in life direction, and the struggle with self-worth in the face of significant decisions. Career change and the search for personal wellbeing were central motifs.
