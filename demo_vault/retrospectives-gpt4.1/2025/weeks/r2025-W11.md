## 1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors

The week was dominated by a series of painful social interactions, culminating in acute experiences of exclusion and rejection. The initial stressor was an assembly hosted by nobility where the author was subject to overt and subtle social snubs—ignored by acquaintances, spoken of in whispers, and ultimately asked to leave. This incident amplified feelings of humiliation, distress, and public scrutiny, especially as news spread socially. The following day brought a deeply emotional confrontation with Miss B—, where she confessed her own suffering due to association with the author and her inability to defend him against social condemnation. Both events underscored a growing sense of alienation and left the author in a heightened state of emotional turmoil.

## 2. Changes in Mood or Energy

Mood fluctuated sharply—from initial hopefulness and brief moments of delight, through escalating frustration and humiliation, to bitter anguish and despair. Encounters with social judgment produced pronounced spikes in distress, followed by short-lived solace in literary pursuits and isolated reflection. Overall, the emotional trajectory was downward: each interaction led to deeper agitation, culminating in acute emotional pain with little evidence of stabilization or recovery.

## 3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)

Mental health was marked by overwhelming emotional reactivity: intense rumination, persistent feelings of persecution and self-blame, and repeated references to self-harm ideation and dramatic escape fantasies. Physical health was not directly referenced, but metaphorical language suggests considerable psychosomatic distress. Sleep and other physical routines were not specified.

## 4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns

Patterns of compulsive rumination and self-criticism were frequent, particularly after painful social encounters. The author vacillated between seeking solitude (withdrawing to read and reflect), and compulsively revisiting the details and perceived injustices of each event. Avoidance manifested as a rapid exit from hostile situations, while emotional overwhelm occasionally led to expressions of both inward (self-directed anger) and outward (violent fantasies) compulsions.

## 5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions

Despite the pain, meaningful actions included attempts at direct communication (confronting Miss B— for clarity), and seeking literary comfort (reading Homer at sunset). There was also reflective insight into one’s lack of fit within certain social milieus and the futility of attempting to conform to external expectations.

## 6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)

Major themes include social exclusion and alienation, the destructive impact of public judgment, and the acute sensitivity to perceived slights. Emotional turmoil pervades each entry, with literary escape and moments of self-reflection offering only temporary respite. The power of words—both harmful and consoling—was underscored, echoing a struggle to process and survive repeated social injuries.
