# r2025-W21

1. Weekly Highlights & Stressors  
This week was marked by a significant revelation: the admission of a long-held ambition to join the army. The process of disclosing this secret plan to a trusted confidant—the prince, who is also a general—was a highlight that brought relief through honest conversation but also surfaced deep-seated disappointment. The prince’s rational counterpoint led to the abandonment of this cherished goal, introducing a new source of stress and possible uncertainty about future direction.

2. Changes in Mood or Energy  
Mood fluctuated from the anticipation of sharing a hidden ambition, to resignation and mild disheartenment upon acknowledging the wisdom in abandoning the plan. While there was some underlying stress related to the relinquishment of a long-term aspiration, the act of open communication allowed for moments of clarity and acceptance.

3. Health Trends (Mental & Physical)  
No notable physical health data was present, but mental health was characterized by introspection, disappointment, and subsequent acceptance. There were signs of stress associated with letting go of personal dreams, counterbalanced by a constructive, reflective mindset.

4. Compulsive or Avoidant Behavior Patterns  
A pattern emerged of keeping secrets until decisive moments, possibly to prevent premature judgment or interference. Ultimately, there was a willingness to defer to trusted authority when faced with a compelling argument, suggesting some avoidant tendencies replaced by pragmatic acceptance.

5. Meaningful Actions or Decisions  
The core action was the difficult, honest conversation with the prince—revealing secret motives and thoughtfully accepting guidance to drop the army plan. This choice demonstrated maturity, self-reflection, and respect for rational counsel over impulsive desire.

6. Emerging Themes (from tags or links)  
Recurring themes include unfulfilled ambitions, the complexity of secrecy, the search for guidance, the navigation of personal versus external expectations, and the role of reflective surrender in growth.
