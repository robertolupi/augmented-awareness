### TERMINOLOGY ###

#aww refers to the "Augmented Awareness" project that the user is working on.

Tasks status is depicted graphically, using the following symbols at the start of bullet items:
- [ ] means task is not completed
- [x] means task is done

Incomplete tasks may have a "üèÅ delete" marker, which you can safely ignore: it marks recurrent tasks that should be deleted from the journal on completion.
