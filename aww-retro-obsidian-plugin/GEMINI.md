# Obsidian Retrospective Plugin

## Goal

This project is to develop an Obsidian plugin that automates the management of retrospectives (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly) by summarizing existing journal notes.

## Core Features

- Support for different time-based retrospectives:
    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Monthly
    - Yearly

## File Naming Conventions

### Journal Notes

Journal notes are the source material for retrospectives and follow a chronological naming scheme.

- **Daily:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-01-02.md`)
- **Weekly:** `gggg-Www.md` (e.g., `2025-W01.md`)
- **Monthly:** `YYYY-MM.md` (e.g., `2025-01.md`)
- **Yearly:** `YYYY.md` (e.g., `2025.md`)

### Retrospective Notes

Retrospective notes are generated by the plugin and are named by prepending an 'r' to the corresponding journal note's name.

- **Daily:** `rYYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `r2025-01-02.md`)
- **Weekly:** `rgggg-Www.md` (e.g., `r2025-W01.md`)
- **Monthly:** `rYYYY-MM.md` (e.g., `r2025-01.md`)
- **Yearly:** `rYYYY.md` (e.g., `r2025.md`)
